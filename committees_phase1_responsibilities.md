## Notes for Phase 1 Task Tables

- **Type column**: Indicates if a task is a 🗓️ Meeting (with specified committee(s)), a 🚩 Milestone, or a regular task (blank).
- **Depends On column**: Lists prerequisite tasks that must be completed before this task can begin, ensuring logical and feasible sequencing for committees.
- **Meetings**: Clearly marked with 🗓️ and specify which committee(s) are involved. These are key coordination points and should be scheduled after prerequisite tasks.
- **Milestones**: Marked with 🚩 and represent major checkpoints or deliverables in the process.
- **Task sequencing**: All dependencies are made explicit to ensure the Gantt chart and committee planning are realistic and actionable.
- **Procedure**: Follow this structure for all future phases to maintain clarity, consistency, and effective project management.
