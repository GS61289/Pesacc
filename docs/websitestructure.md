Building an informative website for Cognia accreditation on GitHub Pages, especially with the assistance of an AI tool like Cursor AI, requires a clear technical approach. Here's how you can provide that to Cursor AI:
Technical Approach for Cognia Accreditation Website on GitHub Pages
You'll essentially be guiding Cursor AI to build a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. This means the website will consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, without a backend server or database. This is ideal for informational content and is the core functionality of GitHub Pages.
Here's a breakdown of the technical approach, detailing what you'd communicate to Cursor AI:
1. Project Setup and Hosting
 * Platform: GitHub Pages.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It should understand the limitations (static files only) and capabilities (free hosting, version control via Git). It might suggest using the gh-pages branch or the main branch with a /docs folder for deployment.
 * Version Control: Git and GitHub.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "All website code will be managed using Git and hosted on a GitHub repository."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It should be aware of commit, push, pull requests, and general GitHub workflows.
2. Website Structure and Content Management
 * Website Type: Static site.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "This will be a static informational website."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It won't need to consider server-side languages or databases.
 * Content Management: Markdown for ease of updates.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Content for pages (like 'Comprehensive Plan' or 'Timeline') should primarily be written in Markdown for easy editing by non-developers. Use Markdown files (.md) for content and integrate them into HTML templates."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: This strongly suggests using a Static Site Generator (SSG).
 * Recommended Static Site Generator (SSG): Jekyll (GitHub Pages' native SSG) or Hugo/Eleventy.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI (Option A - Simpler for GitHub Pages): "We should use Jekyll as the static site generator because it's natively supported by GitHub Pages and simplifies deployment."
   * Instruction to Cursor AI (Option B - More flexible, but might require GitHub Actions): "Alternatively, consider Hugo or Eleventy for faster build times and more flexibility, but be aware this might require a GitHub Actions workflow for deployment."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will need to generate the necessary SSG configuration files, folder structure, and templating logic (e.g., Liquid for Jekyll, Go templates for Hugo).
 * File Structure:
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Organize the website logically. For instance:
     * /_layouts (if using Jekyll) for common page structures.
     * /_includes (if using Jekyll) for reusable components (header, footer, navigation).
     * /pages or similar for individual content pages (e.g., comprehensive-plan.md, timeline.md).
     * /assets for CSS, JavaScript, images.
     * index.html as the homepage."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will set up the foundational directories and files.
3. Design and User Interface (UI)
 * Styling: Modern and responsive CSS framework.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Use a popular and responsive CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and mobile-friendliness."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will include the necessary framework files and apply classes for layout, typography, and components.
 * Theming: Simple, professional, and clear.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "The design should be clean, professional, and easy to navigate. Focus on readability and clear presentation of information."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will prioritize simple color schemes, legible fonts, and intuitive navigation.
 * Navigation: Clear top-level navigation and possibly sidebar navigation for sub-sections.
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Implement a clear navigation menu including 'Comprehensive Plan', 'Timeline', 'Committees', and 'Subcommittees'. Consider a secondary navigation for sub-sections within 'Committees' and 'Subcommittees'."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will generate the HTML for the navigation structure and associated CSS.
4. Specific Content Sections
 * Comprehensive Plan and Division:
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Create a dedicated section for the 'Comprehensive Plan'. This section should allow for multiple sub-pages or accordion sections to divide the plan into manageable parts (e.g., 'Vision & Mission', 'Goals', 'Strategies', 'Evidence'). Each sub-section should have a clear title and content area."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will need to structure content hierarchically.
 * Timeline:
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Develop an interactive or clearly laid out timeline section showing key dates and milestones of the Cognia accreditation process. This could be a chronological list, a visual timeline, or a table."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will generate HTML for a timeline display, potentially with some JavaScript for interactivity if chosen.
 * Committees and Subcommittees Distribution:
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "For 'Committees' and 'Subcommittees', create sections that allow for:
     * Listing committee/subcommittee names.
     * Describing their purpose and responsibilities.
     * Listing members (name, role).
     * Potentially linking to documents or resources relevant to each committee."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will need to handle structured data, potentially using tables or card layouts for readability.
5. Deployment and Automation (for GitHub Pages)
 * Standard GitHub Pages Deployment:
   * Instruction to Cursor AI: "Configure the GitHub repository for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages upon pushes to the main branch (or gh-pages branch, depending on the chosen setup)."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will set up the _config.yml (for Jekyll) or guide on the GitHub repository settings.
 * GitHub Actions (if using non-Jekyll SSG or custom build steps):
   * Instruction to Cursor AI (if not using Jekyll): "If we opt for an SSG other than Jekyll (like Hugo or Eleventy), generate a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to build the static site and deploy it to GitHub Pages."
   * Implication for Cursor AI: It will write the YAML configuration for the CI/CD pipeline.
6. AI Interaction Specifics with Cursor AI
When interacting with Cursor AI, be explicit and break down your requests. You can start broad and then refine:
 * Initial Prompt: "I need to build a static informative website for school Cognia accreditation. It will be hosted on GitHub Pages. The main sections are Comprehensive Plan, Timeline, Committees, and Subcommittees. Help me with the technical setup and initial page generation."
 * Follow-up prompts (examples):
   * "Suggest a suitable static site generator for GitHub Pages and explain why."
   * "Generate the basic Jekyll (or Hugo/Eleventy) project structure."
   * "Create an index.html and a basic navigation bar linking to the main sections."
   * "Show me how to create a Markdown file for the 'Comprehensive Plan' and display its content on a page."
   * "Design a responsive layout for the 'Timeline' section, perhaps using a vertical timeline style."
   * "Provide the HTML and CSS for a 'Committees' section that lists committee names and allows for expandable details for each."
   * "How can I ensure the website is mobile-friendly?"
   * "Generate the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the site to GitHub Pages."
By providing this structured technical approach, you'll empower Cursor AI to generate accurate and relevant code and guidance for your Cognia accreditation website. Remember to iterate and refine your prompts as you go, providing feedback to Cursor AI on its output.
