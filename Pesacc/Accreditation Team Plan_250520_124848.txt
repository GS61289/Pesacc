Here's a comprehensive plan to guide our school towards successful accreditation:
I. Core Planning Principles
● Distributed Leadership: Accreditation is a school-wide effort. I will empower staff
members by creating diverse teams, fostering collaboration, and ensuring shared
ownership.
● Data-Driven Decision Making: We will collect, analyze, and use data from multiple
sources to inform our self-assessment and improvement plan.
● Continuous Improvement: The accreditation process is not a one-time event, but an
ongoing cycle of evaluation, planning, implementation, and monitoring.
● Transparency and Communication: I will ensure all stakeholders (staff, students,
parents, and the community) are informed and involved throughout the process.
II. Team Structure
To effectively manage the accreditation process, I will establish a multi-tiered team structure:
1. Accreditation Steering Committee:
○ Purpose: To oversee the entire accreditation process, ensuring alignment with
Cognia standards and timelines.
○ Composition:
■ Principal (Myself) - Overall leader
■ Assistant Principal(s) - Support various aspects.

○ Responsibilities:

■ Coordinate the work of sub-committees.
■ Monitor progress towards goals.
■ Ensure that the self-assessment is completed.
■ Prepare for the Cognia site visit.
■ Celebrate successes and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
2. Sub-Committees:
○ Purpose: To focus on specific Cognia standards or key characteristics.
○ Composition: Teachers, staff members, and administrators with relevant expertise.
○ Examples of Sub-Committees (aligned with Cognia Standards):
■ Culture of Learning Sub-Committee
■ Leadership for Learning Sub-Committee
■ Engagement of Learning Sub-Committee
■ Growth in Learning Sub-Committee
