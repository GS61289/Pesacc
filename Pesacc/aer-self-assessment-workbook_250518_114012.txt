Introduction to the Self-
Assessment Workbook
The Self-Assessment Workbook: A Guide for Systems and Institutions Seeking or Continuing Accreditation is
designed to provide you with comprehensive information about the Cognia approaches to accreditation and
continuous improvement and what they mean to your system or institution. The workbook gives you access
to information, resources, and tools for your system’s or institution’s continuous improvement journey through
the reflective Self-Assessment process and your participation in Cognia Accreditation Engagement Reviews.
It also provides space for your institution to draft your responses to standard ratings and narratives that will
be populated into the online Self-Assessment Diagnostics prior to your Accreditation Engagement Review.
Throughout the workbook you will find:
• Narrative descriptions of essential research, frameworks, policies, standards, requirements, and
approaches to continuous improvement. This detailed information sets the stage and rationale for
continuous improvement through accreditation.
• Step-by-step guidance on how to engage in the Self-Assessment process within your system or institution
community and how to prepare for a successful Accreditation Engagement Review.
• Activities to help you draft your responses to the various diagnostics you will be required to submit in
Cognia’s online platform. You can use this workbook to rate standards and assurances, craft your Executive
Summary, narratives, and analyses, and collect evidence. This will support your ability to quickly complete all
online diagnostics as they are made available once your review has been scheduled.
• Links to resources to assist you in your improvement journey as you pursue and maintain accreditation.
The links are routinely updated. While you may access this information at any time, Cognia encourages you to
download documents just before you need them to ensure you have the most recent version.
Headings and subheadings will help you navigate to information pertinent to your interests and needs at the time.
As always, Cognia welcomes your feedback and suggestions for making this handbook a more meaningful tool.
Accreditation may be conferred to an institution or a system. For system accreditation, all schools managed by
the system must be accredited or be in the accreditation process. The system is granted accreditation in addition
to the accreditation conferred upon each institution. Throughout this workbook, the term institution is used when
referencing either a system or a single institution.

Cognia Accreditation and
Certification Policies
The Policies and Procedures for Accreditation and Certification represent the unified policies and procedures
for accreditation and certification from Cognia and its accreditation divisions: the North Central Association
Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI), the Northwest Accreditation Commission
(NWAC), and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School
Improvement (SACS CASI). Therefore, all references to Cognia in this workbook collectively refer to NCA CASI,
NWAC, and SACS CASI.
Cognia maintains policies that are available for public access on the Cognia website at cognia.org. As of July 1,
2015, any institution that is accredited by Cognia is awarded a seal that collectively reflects NCA CASI, NWAC,
and SACS CASI accreditation. Systems and institutions seeking accreditation are responsible for adhering to all
Cognia policies and procedures as a condition of ongoing accreditation, which is certified at the beginning of each
new accreditation term through Cognia Assurances.
Definitions
The Cognia Accreditation policies and procedures provide definitions for performance. This workbook aligns
with these definitions as information is presented about accreditation. The workbook reflects accreditation
only; information about certification is presented in documents unique to the specific certifications (e.g., STEM
Certification, Competency-Based Education Certification).
1. Accreditation. A voluntary method of quality assurance, developed more than 130 years ago by
American universities and secondary schools, that is designed primarily to recognize institutions
adhering to a set of educational standards and policies. Accreditation applies to an entire institution or
system.
2. Certification. A voluntary process of quality assurance that yields a documented recognition of
achievement of a defined process of program. Certification may apply to a process or program of an
institution or to an institution as a whole. Accreditation is a prerequisite or concurrent requirement for
certification.
3. Institution. Any educational unit such as a school, association, charter school authorizer, education
service organization, or state education agency that is seeking accreditation or certification as a single
entity.
4. System. Any organization such as a corporation, district, education service agency with schools, or
system of institutions that is seeking accreditation for the system as a whole, including the organization’s
system level and all of the institutions managed by the system.
The policies and procedures provide applicability requirements specific to systems and institutions and
procedural requirements for Cognia related to all aspects of accreditation recognition and management.

Essential Skills and Knowledge
Introduction to Accreditation
Since its introduction into the education landscape in the late 1800s, accreditation has served as the standard
bearer for what a good school does to ensure that learners are ready and prepared for their future. In the first
100 years, accreditation focused on the accomplishments of an institution in its recent past as well as the
necessary inputs to ensure a good school. However, for the past 20 years, modern accreditation has focused on
where the institution is heading with respect to its mission and purpose. Today, accredited institutions commit to a
journey of ongoing improvement.
Accreditation is the most widely used improvement process in the world. It is distinctly different from other
improvement processes. Accreditation is a standards-based, ongoing improvement process that includes expert
third-party professional review and feedback. While traditional improvement processes focus on creating and
implementing an improvement plan, accreditation supports and guides the improvement journey through the
application of research-based Performance Standards coupled with evaluative feedback from professional
peers.
The accreditation process that your institution and community are about to embark on has three phases:
1) Reflection and Analysis, 2) Engagement, and 3) Progress and Feedback. This workbook will describe the
activities and resources offered to support your ongoing efforts as you cycle through the phases of improvement.
Additionally, the workbook provides guidance on building your capacity and capability to leverage your skills
to gather and analyze data; collect and interpret evidence; and establish and sustain a culture of ongoing
improvement.
Today, accreditation is used at all levels of education and is recognized for its ability to effectively drive improved
learner performance and continuous improvement in education.
Systems and institutions seeking to achieve or maintain accreditation understand, honor, and embrace the concept
of continuous improvement. These systems and institutions are engaged every day in a process of continuous
improvement. They are dynamic and continuously evolving, with an unrelenting focus on becoming better on
behalf of the learners they serve. They operate in learning communities by demonstrating healthy cultures where
individuals collectively analyze practices and results, engage in professional learning and dialogue, take meaningful
action, and assume responsibility for results.
Accreditation requires systems and institutions to continuously meet the applicable Cognia policies, standards, and
requirements. Cognia refers to the collective efforts and actions of the institution to continuously meet accreditation
expectations as the improvement journey. This journey should progress in ways that are personalized, relevant, and
meaningful on behalf of the learners being served.
Periodically, Cognia will review the institution through on-site visitations that are specific to the purpose of the review.
Such reviews may include candidacy reviews, accreditation engagement reviews, monitoring reviews, or other
specialized reviews as outlined in the Policies and Procedures for Accreditation and Certification.

Engaging in Continuous Improvement
Cognia defines continuous improvement as “an embedded behavior rooted in an institution’s culture that
constantly focuses on conditions, processes, and practices to improve teaching and learning.” Accreditation
is a continuous improvement process that helps an institution improve teaching and learning. Using Cognia’s
Performance Standards, the institution examines its current effectiveness as well as its capacity and capability to
achieve its vision and goals for the future.
Cognia believes all institutions can improve, no matter how well they are currently performing. In the same
manner that educators are expected to understand the unique needs of every learner and tailor the education
experience to drive student success, every institution must be empowered to map out and embrace their unique
improvement journey. Cognia expects institutions to use the results and analyses of data from diverse sources
to select and implement actions that drive improvement in education quality and learner performance. Cognia
recognizes that each institution’s improvement journey is unique, and that we can serve you best by providing key
findings specific to your institution.
Around the turn of the 21st century, accreditation transformed its focus and process from a ten-year evaluation
focused on the accomplishments of an institution’s past decade to a forward-focused process examining what
an institution is striving to accomplish in the next six years. Modern accreditation examines the current and
future capabilities and capacities of an institution in the context of its mission, purpose, and direction. The Cognia
Performance Standards define how a good institution behaves and provide the criteria to focus improvement
efforts that will lead to growing learners, teachers, and leaders.
Modern accreditation is a continuous improvement process. At least every six years, the institution formally
engages the Cognia Performance Standards to reflect and examine its progress toward its desired future as
expressed through its mission, purpose, and strategic direction. Cognia’s purpose-driven, strategic process is the
most widely used continuous improvement process in the world.
Skills for Ongoing Improvement
Cognia Accreditation is synonymous with the philosophy of continuous improvement. Cognia believes that using
our standards and key characteristics as a framework for your continuous improvement work is a major factor
in your ongoing success. The standards provide metrics to help evaluate your work. The key characteristics give
you a format to synthesize everything you know about your institution holistically.
The improvement process begins with creating a vision of the future and determining your current reality through
the process of collecting and analyzing data. You can learn much more about these processes from Cognia’s
book, “inFocus: A Guide for Strategic Thinking and Improvement Planning.” The section below is about collecting
and analyzing data. Once you have completed the data analysis process, you can more easily select improvement
goals. Then, use Cognia’s Strategies tool or any of the myriad of action planning processes available in the
literature to outline your next steps. Cognia offers professional development opportunities in all these areas. We
will not get into action plans here, but if you are not familiar with Strategies or with the action planning process,
contact your Cognia Representative.
Let us begin with some definitions. Here are Cognia definitions for some key terms.
You have lots of data in your institution. You may even be familiar with the phrase “data rich, information poor.”
Data can come from written or verbal sources, using data collection tools, or instruments. Data, in and of
themselves, are not particularly helpful. Why do we say that? Because by simply looking at data, you cannot
determine what you are doing to improve. When you look at one data point, or even multiple data points, but do
not connect them in some way, any inference of improvement may simply be a “chance occurrence.”
Many people fear the word analysis. Granted, the word is often associated with complex statistical and
mathematical equations; but for Cognia, it’s simply a process for thoughtful review and grouping seemingly
random data points in a way that make sense. One of the questions we want to answer when we analyze data is,
5
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
“Why did these results come out like they did?” In fact, if you ask the question “why?” five times, you are engaging
in what we call “root cause analysis” which helps you get to the essence of what the data are trying to tell. Be
thoughtful. Be honest with yourself. Listen to the data, even if they are telling you what you don’t want to hear.
The result of analysis is information. Information describes what you have been doing and how your actions have
affected student performance and organizational effectiveness. To be most effective, you should write down
your analyses in a narrative format. We cannot stress too much the importance of information—that is, a written
record of the results of your analyses of the data. Without a thorough analysis, any conclusion you reach will be an
educated guess at best.
Like the word analysis, synthesis frightens some people. However, synthesis is a simple process of using
information from multiple sources to reach a conclusion. Did you notice that “analysis” makes meaning of data
while “synthesis” makes meaning of information? When you think of it that way, you’ll realize you are moving from a
“micro” perspective to a “macro” perspective.
Synthesis is a process that helps you to arrive at findings. Findings are conclusive statements—based on facts—
that help you focus on what matters. And it’s not difficult! Simply say to yourself, “based on all the information we
analyzed and synthesized, we found that…” Many times, you will hear people say, “Based on the data…” Be careful
when using that phrase because you can arrive at erroneous findings if you don’t include the processes and
results of analysis, information, and synthesis. Findings help us determine areas where we perform well and areas
we need to improve.
Not all information or every finding can be called evidence. Evidence is ONLY—and we stress the word only
here—information that supports your findings. So many times, people will provide vast amounts of useless
data and information that are unrelated to the problem at hand. Perhaps they feel that the “quantity” of data or
information is more important than the “quality” of the information. Actually, it’s the opposite. A few high-quality
sources of information that clearly identify the problem and inform you about it can help you stay focused and
not get lost or overwhelmed in oceans of meaningless data and information. Be very selective when you choose
information to use as evidence.
How do all these words work together? You may want to think of this as a process that takes raw material (data)
and makes it into a useful product (evidence).

Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Data Collection, Analysis, and Synthesis
In continuous improvement work, and especially in accreditation preparation, many institutions collect data and
then stop. They think they’re done! Simply collecting and presenting raw data is virtually meaningless! Look at the
example below. By just looking at random puzzle pieces on the left, you can’t make much meaning of the puzzle.
But once you study all the pieces and arrange them in a logical order, those random puzzle pieces become a
meaningful picture.
Data Before Analysis and Synthesis Data After Analysis and Synthesis
You should use data collection, analysis, and synthesis techniques in all your improvement work. This process
is especially important as you try to complete your Self-Assessment of Cognia Assurances, Performance
Standards, Key Characteristics, and Reflection.
It is impossible to analyze and synthesize data if you do not understand the concept of sources of information. At
Cognia, we recommend looking at four categories of data. You may have multiple sources under each category.
The four categories we recommend are:
1. Documentation: Cognia defines “documentation” as written, printed, or electronic matter that is usually
widely distributed and serves as an official record. Examples of documents that may be sources of data are:
a. Institution handbooks (for faculty/staff, student, parent, etc.)
b. Strategic plans
c. Action plans (continuous improvement plan, professional development plan, technology plan)
d. Policies, procedures, processes
2. Observations: Cognia encourages both formal and informal observations. Some examples of
observations include:
a. Locally collected Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool® (eleot) observations
b. Teacher observations
c. Other general observations (evaluations of meetings, general comments from stakeholders)
3. Perceptions: Perceptions are reality for stakeholders. Some examples of perception gathering
techniques include:
a. Surveys
b. Focus groups
c. Interviews
4. Performance: Cognia looks for two types of information in this category. While student performance
is the most important “outcome” for an institution, organizational performance supports student
performance. Here are some examples of data you may collect related to performance:
a. Organizational data (results of improvement or other initiatives, program evaluation, non-academic
performance metrics, efficiency studies)
b. Student academic performance data (formative and summative data, aggregated or individual)
c. Student non-academic performance data (attendance, disciplinary, participation in extracurricular
activities)
7
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
A few words here about program evaluation: There are two outcomes to consider when evaluating programs
or initiatives in your institution. The first is data concerning the implementation of the program or initiative.
Implementation data is often collected in the initial stages of the implementation of the program to inform
the quality and fidelity of the implementation, as well as to monitor and adjust the program goals. Because
implementation evaluation is generally done early in the process of program development and implementation,
the data is often more qualitative in nature and relies on more formative assessment data. The purpose of
implementation evaluation is to improve the program goals and plans to ensure successful outcomes.
The second form of data comes from the impact of the program. Impact data is collected as a measure of the
results of the program. This type of evaluation is more frequently conducted later in the program implementation
and often relies on more quantitative and summative data that measures the outcome or impact of the program.
It answers the question “Did the program work?”
Here is a key lesson to learn for your Accreditation Engagement Review: If you simply present raw data,
your evaluators will not have the time to organize, analyze and interpret it. They may not even have time to access
all the random data you have provided! Learn this lesson well: For data to be useful to your Cognia Engagement
Review evaluators and to the personnel in your institution for continuous improvement the analyses of those data
should be presented, not the raw results.
Five Steps for Data Analysis
Just like any standardized quality process, the data analysis process consists of certain steps:
1. Understand the purpose for your analysis.
2. Identify and evaluate data sources and collect data.
3. Clean all data and eliminate unnecessary data.
4. Analyze and synthesize the data.
5. Interpret findings, prioritize, and develop a theory of action.
You can use the five steps above and the additional information below to analyze any project. Because this
document is specific to Cognia Accreditation, we will be discussing this process as it relates to the standards
and key characteristics you are asked to evaluate for your Engagement Review. Therefore, the purpose of your
analyses is to find evidence to evaluate your institution against standards and key characteristics. We have taken
care of Step 1!
Some best practices we’ve discovered: Use documentation you already have whenever possible! You may find
that you need different data later, but start with what you have. Also, you should have an “analysis team” dedicated
to completing this work. That team could be your leadership team, improvement team, or people working in
professional learning communities. Finally, when the analysis is complete, make sure to share it with the broader
community, or at least the internal community.

Activity: Identifying Data Sources and Data Collection Instruments
As a group, discuss and list the data sources you already have, using the four categories described earlier
(Documentation, Observations, Perceptions, and Performance) as a general guide. When you finish, reflect on
what you have and where you need to add more collection instruments if necessary. Alternatively, you can use the
Activity below with a larger group.

Cleaning Data
Many statisticians have stated that “cleaning” data is perhaps the most important step in data analysis, and it can
also be the most time-consuming. Without proper attention to data cleaning, there are many mistakes that can be
made with data. Data are the foundation of all your subsequent work. If the foundation of a building is not well built,
the integrity of the entire building structure is at risk.
Evaluating data sources is a critical factor in achieving accurate analyses. There are two considerations
for evaluating data when cleaning. You will save time and reduce frustration if you pay attention to these
considerations before beginning your analysis and synthesis.
First, some data you have collected may not be even remotely related to the problem you are attempting to solve.
This part is easy: Just push it aside! If you do not, you and your colleagues will be overwhelmed and unable to
focus on the problem at hand.
Second, you must evaluate the data to ensure that it is specific, valid, and accurate. Unreliable data sources can
lead us to make conclusions about the data that may not hold up to later scrutiny. This can be a difficult and timeconsuming
task, but it is worth the effort. Here are some common mistakes people make when evaluating their
data sources:
• Inadequate sample size. If the sample size of a study is too small, we cannot reasonably make
generalizations to the entire population of interest. For example, if your school has 1,000 students and you
only asked the student government group of 10 students how people feel about the school, the results will
most likely fail to reflect the views of the whole student body.
• Poor data collection methods. It is difficult to gather quality data when using subpar collection methods,
such as asking survey questions that are worded in a way to lead people toward certain responses.
• Anecdotal data. People sometimes present anecdotal data as equivalent to scientifically collected study
data, such as relying on product testimonials or word of mouth claims rather than a statistical method of
study. Be careful when you see a single comment beginning with “I think” or “I believe.” Be able to say, “I know,
and here’s how I know.”
• Collection of biased data. Sometimes people collect only data that support a certain agenda, so there is a
stake in the results making claims for or against that agenda. You must be a skilled “data consumer,” and look
for these clues to determine if there is a question about the reliability of the data source.
• Faulty logic. If data collection instruments are not carefully designed, they can lead to faulty responses
because they are confusing to the respondent. Asking people if a leader is friendly may not indicate whether
the institution has quality instruction. Survey questions can also be confusing. You may be familiar with the
term “double-barreled” questions. For example, if a survey item says, “The quality and quantity of our data
sources are sufficient for our needs.” What if people think the quantity is fine, but the quality is poor? How can
they answer the question accurately, and more importantly, what are the odds you will be able to make sense
of the responses?
• Interpretation of data. Too often, we draw hasty conclusions and generalizations based on incomplete data
or inaccurate data. It is also common to assign cause when the data only show correlation, or a relationship
between two things rather than a cause and effect. For example, let us say our data show more shark attacks
when ice cream sales at a beach are high. Do a lot of ice cream sales cause more shark attacks? That is
not something we could prove as a cause and effect. Why do the data support this relationship? A common
reason is what we call a confounding variable, which is another factor that has a relationship to both things
that are of interest. The confounding variable in this case is the number of people at the beach, which is
related to both more ice cream sales and more shark attacks, simply because there are more people at the
beach.
– Poorly represented data can be misleading and can result in an inaccurate interpretation
– Incorrect graph style—bar graph vs. line graph vs. circle graph
– Confusing visualization—clutter, no scale, overly stimulating

The table below contains some examples of data cleaning ideas. Documents are usually overly broad, cover many
topics, and are sometimes many pages long. Data cleaning means being specific about precisely which parts of
the document apply to the analysis. Selecting the important data from a document is like citing a reference in a
term paper. You do not cite the entire book; you cite the specific pages from the book that contain information to
support your needs. The same goes for other sources such as questionnaires and surveys. Rather than say, “The
parent survey data,” which may include many items with information applicable to many topics, say, “Items 1, 17,
and 20 (related to leadership) of the Parent Questionnaire.”

It’s during the data cleaning process that you may find, once again, that you need to collect more or different
data. It is better to stop and collect that data immediately rather than moving on with inadequate, insufficient, or
inaccurate data. You also may find that as you begin the analysis and synthesis work, you may have to come back
and “reclean” some of your data sources, especially when you begin to focus on specific themes.
Using the data sources you identified from the earlier activity, review your data sources and begin to determine
if they are impacted by any of the considerations above. Once you have completed that step, develop an action
plan to correct any issues with your data sources and begin to organize specific components of your data. You
may wish to use the activity linked below.
Analyzing and Synthesizing Information
Once all your “cleaned” data is in one place, you can begin to analyze and synthesize. Remember the puzzle we
showed earlier? That is what analysis and synthesis is: putting those pieces together to create a holistic “picture”
of your organization; but your organizational picture will not be a photograph, it will be based on themes. Some
themes are “assigned” (like the key characteristics) while others may emerge as you study your data.
First, you will review and organize all your data to create information. As you review different pieces of data, you
will find that they begin to cluster around certain themes. This can be a fun exercise for a group using some quality
management tools like an affinity diagram. As the themes begin to develop, determine if you have adequate data
or if you need more. You may also find you have collected some data that does not fit with any of the themes. If
you have data that never aligns with a theme, just put it to one side. You might even begin to classify each data
point as a “positive result” or “negative result.”
Once you get all the data categorized under themes, give the themes one- or two-word names. You already
have four broad themes: culture, leadership, engagement, and growth. You may see many more specific themes
emerge, such as data management, professional learning, student discipline—the possibilities are endless. You
may find that most of these specific themes are subcomponents of one or more of the key characteristics. That
may help you not only to prepare for your engagement review, but also with tasks such as selecting improvement
goals and budget prioritization. You can also expect an occasional theme that does not seem to fit with any of the
key characteristics; do not worry, and do not try to force a theme to fit where it does not.
Interpreting Findings, Developing Theories of Action, and Prioritizing
Interpreting your findings really answers the question, “Does this matter to us?” Now that you have your
information organized and arranged under themes, it is time to transform your information into findings. For this
step, you will be reflecting on your organized information and writing a statement that succinctly defines what you
have discovered. This statement is called a “finding.” Findings help us determine what we do well and what we
11
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
do not do so well. Do not include the solution in your finding: just write a clear statement that indicates what the
information under the theme tells you. Here are some examples:
• Student performance in seventh grade language arts has been lower than sixth- and eighth-grade
performance for the past three years.
• Items related to culture from multiple surveys (learner, teacher, parent) indicate strong support for the
leadership of our school.
• On the SAT, students perform well above the average on language arts and below average on mathematics.
The information you have gathered that aligns with and supports your finding is called “evidence.”
You may have identified many findings, and you may think that prioritizing is simply a process of deciding which
findings we want to work on first, or that findings you should address immediately should be focused on student
results. Cognia strongly recommends you reflect carefully on your findings and develop theories of action to help
you prioritize. Frequently, institutions err in their analysis. The error? Jumping into action before determining the
root cause. We often talk about “treating the symptoms, not the cause.” Here is a sample of this common error:
Finding: Student absenteeism has been increasing for the last four years.
Erroneous Action: Implement a reward program for students who do not miss any days!
Discussion: Student absenteeism is a symptom. We must find out why students are not attending
school regularly. Only then can we determine what actions might improve student absenteeism.
With careful reflection and study of your findings and the associated evidence, followed by development of
theories of action, your institution will not fall prey to this error! And developing a theory of action is relatively
easy:
1. Using your analyses and the finding statement you have developed, determine the possible root cause(s)
of the current outcome described in the finding. Remember that the data and results you have are a
measure of the symptoms, not the root cause. Root cause answers the question, “Why are these results
what they are?” The best technique to accomplish this is using a fishbone diagram (see figure below).

Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Another method of root cause analysis is known as the “Five Whys.” While it may take more or fewer
times asking why, usually five times will help you identify root cause. (See figure below.)
2. Select what you believe to be the top one or two causes you have identified, identify who might be able to
affect change to address the issue, and describe actions that might bring about the desired change.
“After discussion, mathematics faculty felt that curriculum alignment was the highest priority; however,
that is not scheduled until two years from now. Therefore, the faculty decided the three most important
causes in our control are: 1) providing more real-world projects, 2) focusing on critical thinking and
problem solving in instruction, and 3) building a professional development plan to improve math
instruction.”
3. Develop an “if/then/so that” statement (theory of action).
“If math teachers engage in professional development to learn how to increase critical thinking and
implement real-world projects into math classes, then students will be more engaged in learning math so
that they will score higher on the math portion of the SAT.”
Reflecting on your “if/then/so that” statements will help you prioritize your goals and guide you in developing an
action plan.
You may wish to engage in the activity below to help guide your work.
Group Activity: Developing Findings
Group Activity: Writing Theories of Action
Putting It All Together
We have talked a lot about the processes of data analysis, synthesis, interpreting information, and identifying
findings. Now, it is simply a matter of using the results of your efforts to create a clear, concise document. Some
analysis documents will be longer than others, depending upon the complexity of the topic and your theory of
action. Consider creating narrative documents that use the following outline:
First section: evidence you have analyzed and synthesized
Second section: findings from your analysis and synthesis
Third section: interpretations of the root cause of your findings and your theory of action
This has already been mentioned, but it bears repeating: For data to be useful to the personnel in your institution
for continuous improvement, and useful to your Cognia Engagement Review evaluators, the analyses of those
data should be presented, not the raw results.
13
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Now you know the basics of data analysis to help you prepare for your Accreditation Engagement Review. Data
analysis is just like its overarching activity of continuous improvement: The good news is you can begin today,
but the reality is that you will never finish! As you collect new data, you will want to reanalyze and update your
narratives. Keeping these narratives up to date means you will always have them at your fingertips when you need
them for improvement work.
Required Analyses
We have talked about the collection, analysis, and synthesis of data in a general fashion. Before you begin
completing the components of your Self-Assessment, you must complete at least three analyses: one on student
performance data, one on observations of learning environments focused on learner engagement, and one on
survey results. The analysis templates have been provided for you in this section of the workbook.
Cognia requires that you examine and analyze your student performance data to see how well the institution’s
educational program is preparing learners for success in current and future academic work. You likely have
several data sources, with a strong emphasis on the set of assessment tools and practices used to measure
performance. You will use the analysis process in this workbook to analyze your data and synthesize the data into
findings. Note: This analysis is not required for standalone corporations, Education Service Organizations and
Charter School Authorizers, and State Education Agencies.
Cognia requires that you collect stakeholder feedback data from three stakeholder groups: learners (grades 3
and higher), families, and educators. Cognia provides you with certified content surveys for these three
stakeholder groups if you wish to use them. However, you may also use your own survey system or other
stakeholder feedback methods to collect the data. Whichever method you choose, you can use the analysis
process in this workbook to analyze and synthesize your data into findings.
There are advantages to using Cognia’s surveys. First, all the items on the surveys for the three stakeholder
groups are aligned with the four key characteristics you will write about in your Self-Assessment. Additionally, you
can be confident that the Cognia surveys are fully tested and reliable. Later in this document you will be asked
to use our criteria to evaluate the quality of your surveys. If you use Cognia’s surveys, on the criterion concerning
validity and reliability (EC1), you can simply say “We used Cognia’s surveys,” and that will meet the criterion at the
highest level.
The final required analysis is a study of learning environments in you institution. This can most easily be
completed using data from Cognia’s eleot observations, but if you have another instrument that assesses learning
environments, you may use it. Please note: You CANNOT use a teacher observation instrument of any kind to
meet the expectations of this requirement. This analysis is not about the teacher alone, it is about the overall
learning environment, which focuses primarily on what learners are doing, not teachers. Note: This analysis is not
required for standalone corporations, Education Service Organizations and Charter School Authorizers, or State
Education Agencies.
Student Performance Analysis
Most people will agree that the desired outcome of education is successful learner performance. By simply
looking at test results, the chances of improving learner performance are slim. This tool will help you use the five
steps explained earlier to analyze your assessment data so that you can make impactful changes that will result in
improved learner performance.
Below are steps to guide you in this analysis.
1. Understand the Purpose for Your Analysis
The careful analysis of student performance data might seem self-evident, yet it is a critical step that
many institutions fail to perform, or only one or two people in the institution are involved. Here are some
activities you might consider:
14
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
• Agree to approach the process and analysis reporting with honesty and transparency.
• Determine the level of commitment of the personnel in your institution to using the results of this
analysis to improve across the entire institution.
• Review the four Assessment Package Evaluative Criteria.
2. Identify and Evaluate Data Sources (Process)
Make a list of assessments that your institution uses to measure student performance. You may have
already made a longer list of all data sources in an earlier activity.
• Create a table similar to the sample below. Your table will most likely have many more rows than this
sample! In this table, all data sources will fall under the category of “performance,” so there is no need
to list that here.
• Include data from summative assessments that support the mission of your institution (such as core
academics or performance assessments specific to the purpose of the institution).
• Consider including comparison data to like institutions that have similar learner populations.
For each data source you list:
• List the number of administrations you have for comparison, or describe when the data were collected
(trend data).
• Make any comments that will help you clean and classify the results into themes.

instructional sensitivity*.
1
The array of assessments used by the institution to determine learners’ performance do not include those
required by governmental or other agencies. The assessments are not aligned to required curricula and
adopted learning standards. Few assessments used demonstrate validity, reliability, absence of bias and
instructional sensitivity*.
* Instructional sensitivity is defined as “test’s instructional sensitivity represents the degree to which students’ performances on that
test accurately reflect the quality of the instruction that was provided specifically to promote students’ mastery of whatever is being
assessed” (Popham, 2007).
EC2: Test Administration
4
Almost all the assessments used by the institution to determine learners’ performance have been
administered with complete fidelity. The learners to whom these assessments were administered accurately
represent the populations served by the institution. Evidence of appropriate accommodations have been
provided for all assessments so that valid inferences can be made about all learners’ performance regarding
curricular outcomes.
3
Most of the assessments used by the institution to determine learners’ performance have been administered
with fidelity. In most instances, the learners to whom these assessments were administered represent the
populations served by the institution. Evidence of appropriate accommodations have been provided for most
assessments so that valid inferences can be made about most learners’ performance regarding curricular
outcomes.

EC3: Results of Learning
4
Evidence of learning indicates no significant achievement gaps among subpopulations of learners, or
the achievement gaps have substantially declined. Almost all trend data shows improvement in learner
performance.
3
Evidence of learning indicates achievement gaps exist among subpopulations of learners, and these
achievement gaps have noticeably declined. Most trend data shows improvement in learner performance.
2
Evidence of learning indicates achievement gaps exist among subpopulations of learners, and these
achievement gaps demonstrate a modest decline. Trend data shows neutral or minimally improving learner
performance.
1
Evidence of learning indicates achievement gaps exist among subpopulations of learners and that minimal or
no change has occurred in these achievement gaps. Trend data shows declining learner performance.
EC4: Academic Performance and Growth Outcomes
4
Evidence clearly demonstrates exceptional student growth across multiple years and measures. Student
achievement data demonstrates substantially higher performance than expected, with analyzed data showing
strong mastery of grade-level content across multiple measures.
3
Evidence shows consistent student growth across multiple years and measures. Student achievement data
demonstrates at or above expected performance, with analyzed data showing appropriate mastery of gradelevel
content.
2
Evidence shows inconsistent or limited student growth over time. Student achievement data demonstrated
below expected performance, with limited analysis showing inconsistent master of grade-level content.
1
Evidence shows minimal student growth and/or insufficient trend data. Student achievement data

3. Select and Clean Data Sources
It is likely you will have several pages of charts, graphs, and tables. You may wish to limit each analysis
to one grade level or one subject, or you can analyze all assessment data at once. When selecting
assessment data to include, consider the following criteria:
• Provide longitudinal results of the same assessment from multiple administrations, if available, to allow
for analysis of trends.
• Disaggregate data by subgroups appropriate for your institution.
• Provide tables, graphs or other depictions that provide assessment data with longitudinal results that
are disaggregated by appropriate subgroups for the institution. Use Evaluative Criteria 3 and 4 as your
guides.
• Provide learner performance results by presenting data using status, improvement and/or growth.
– Status: the level of performance on an assessment or group of assessments against a set of criteria.
– Improvement: trend data of the same grade level and/or course over several years.
– Growth: learner cohort data regarding the performance of a group of learners over time.
4. Analyze and Synthesize Information
Analysis and synthesis put the pieces of information you have amassed together to create a holistic
“picture” of your organization in the form of themes. Use the following prompts and questions to guide
your thinking and writing:
• Areas of Noteworthy Achievement
– Provide specific results that demonstrate positive trend(s) in student performance over multiple years.
– Which area(s) were above the expected levels of performance?
– Which subgroup(s) showed a trend toward increasing performance?
– Between which subgroups was the achievement gap closing?
– Discuss why you believe these trends have occurred.
– Which of the above reported findings are supported by other data sources (e.g., perception data,
observation data)?
– Based on assessment results, what improvement decisions/initiatives have been implemented to
improve instruction and related programs (e.g., professional development)?
– Based on assessment results, what positive outcomes have occurred as a result of improvements in
instruction?
Interaction—Enter your findings (answers to the prompts and question above) below or create a

Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
• Areas in Need of Improvement
– Provide specific results that demonstrate any negative trend(s) in student performance.
– Which area(s) were below the expected levels of performance?
– Which subgroup(s) showed a trend toward decreasing performance?
– Between which subgroups was the achievement gap becoming greater?
– Discuss why you believe these trends have occurred.
– Which of the above reported findings are supported by other data sources (e.g., perception
data, observation data)?
– Based on assessment results, what changes in instruction have you found to be ineffective and
consequently discontinued?

5. Interpret Findings, Prioritize, and Develop a Theory of Action
Now that you have your information organized and neatly arranged under themes, it’s time to transform
your information into findings—that is, “what we do well, and where we need to improve.” Refer to the
earlier section on Interpreting Findings, Developing Theories of Action, and Prioritizing. Consider the
following suggestions:
• List all your findings statements
• Prioritize the findings statements:
– Select the findings you feel are most important to begin your improvement process.
– Select only the number of findings you have the capacity to address.
• Perform root cause analysis on the findings to determine how to address the improvement areas and
sustain noteworthy achievements.
• Describe your intended results and next steps (theory of action).
See a sample analysis on page 160.
See how the evaluator will evaluate your analysis on page 171.
Interaction—Enter your priorities and theories of action (answers to the prompts and question
above) below or create a separate document.
Putting It All Together
Using the results of your efforts above, create a clear, concise document in the field below. Consider creating a
narrative document that uses the following outline:
Introduction: Briefly describe the assessments you used, indicating which ones are required by state or ministry
regulation.
First section: Briefly present evidence you have analyzed and synthesized, highlighting methods of
disaggregating data into meaningful subgroups to extract key insights.
Second Section: Discuss your findings from your analysis and synthesis of noteworthy achievements and areas
for improvement.
Third section: Discuss your interpretations of the root causes of your findings and your theories of action guiding
your continuous improvement going forward.
21
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
This has already been mentioned, but it bears repeating: For data to be useful to the personnel in your institution
for continuous improvement, and useful to your Cognia Engagement Review team, the analyses of those data
should be presented, not just the raw results.
Stakeholder Feedback Analysis
“Perception is reality.” You have probably heard and maybe even used this phrase before. Cognia believes
collecting and analyzing data from at least three populations (learners, teachers, and families) can give your
institution insights into your “current reality.” Whether it is survey results, focus group results, or other types of
perception data, this tool will help you use the five steps explained earlier to analyze your perception data so
that you can make impactful changes that will result in improved stakeholder perceptions, which ultimately will
improve student performance.
Below are steps to guide you in this analysis.
1. Understand the Purpose for Your Analysis
This might seem self-evident, yet it is a critical step, even when considering perception or survey results.
Here are some activities you might consider:
• Agree to approach the process and analysis reporting with honesty and transparency.
• Determine the level of commitment of the personnel in your institution to using the results of this
analysis to improve.
• Review the four Evaluative Criteria for Surveys and Perception Data.
2. Identify and Evaluate Data Sources
Review all possible data sources (surveys, focus groups, etc.). List these data sources in the table
provided. For each survey or other data source you list:
• List the populations you have collected perception data from. Cognia requires that you collect at least
learner perceptions, family perceptions, and teacher perceptions.
• Indicate the number of administrations of surveys or focus groups you have for comparison (trend
data).
• For each data source, include comments about the overall validity and reliability of the results and
make note of potential areas for improvement.
• Below are some samples. Your table may include more data sources.
Data Source Trend Data Comments
Cognia Family Survey 2 years We should not compare year one with year two because during the
first year the family survey was only administered to parents who
attended our site council meeting, which is not considered to be
representative of all families.
Cognia Learner Survey 3 years This is a reliable data source as we gave it to all students both
years at about the same time of year. Over 95% of all students
responded.
Cognia Teacher Survey 3 years This is a reliable data source as we gave it to all teachers both
years at about the same time of year. Response rate was 100%.
Principal’s Roundtable 4 years Twice per year the principal invites a group of parent and
community members to a luncheon where school progress,
issues, and concerns are discussed. Only parents and community
members who had time attended, but all 8 sessions had at least 30
participants.

3. Select and Clean Data Sources
When selecting survey data to include, consider the following criteria:
• Organize the items of your surveys under themes. You can always begin with Cognia’s key
characteristics (Culture, Leadership, Engagement, Growth), then add others as you wish. Cognia’s
surveys are already aligned to these key characteristics.
• Provide longitudinal results of the same questions from multiple administrations, if available, to
allow for analysis of trends.
• Provide tables, graphs or other depictions that provide response data with longitudinal results that
are disaggregated by appropriate subgroups (families, learners, teachers, etc.).
4. Analyze and Synthesize Information
Analysis and synthesis put the pieces of information you have amassed together to create a holistic
“picture” of your organization in the form of themes. Use the following questions to guide your thinking
and writing:
• Areas of Noteworthy Achievement
– In which area(s) do stakeholders feel the institution is doing really well?
– Which area(s) indicate the overall highest feedback ratings?
– What successes are highlighted?
– Which of the above reported findings are consistent with findings from other data sources?
Note: These prompts differ from the ones you will see in the online diagnostic. Please respond to
these prompts as you analyze the stakeholder feedback data and upload your narrative into the online

Learning Environment Observation Analysis
1. Understand the Purpose for Your Analysis
You have made a careful analysis of learner engagement observation data. Here are some activities you
should consider:
• Agree to approach the process and analysis reporting with honesty and transparency.
• Determine the level of commitment of the personnel in your institution to using the results of this
analysis to improve across the entire institution.
• Review the three Learning Environment Observation Evaluative Criteria.
2. Identify and Evaluate Data Sources
You should list one or more instruments that your institution uses to measure learner engagement in an
observational format. Considerations for your list:
• Cognia’s eleot (Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool) instrument is considered the
premier learning environment observation tool to measure learner engagement. Cognia also offers
the Cognia Observation Tool for Digital Learning, which is used to measure learner engagement in a

Standards
Continuous improvement should be the goal of every institution. Cognia provides accreditation standards and
assurances that are specific to varying types of systems and institutions. The improvement journey for each
institution may look different but should always include measures of quality of learning and instruction.
The Cognia Performance Standards provide a set of evaluative criteria that lays the foundation for improvement
planning and implementation. Based on rigorous research and best practices, the standards are a powerful
tool for driving instructional change. Education institutions are complex entities where a wide variety of factors
interact interdependently. Viewing these Performance Standards through multiple lenses will give an institution
and its Engagement Review evaluators a holistic portrayal of the institution. While each of Cognia’s Performance
Standards are a measure of the quality of a specific dimension, no standard is independent; it is affected by and
has effect on other standards.
The Standards
If you are familiar with the previous Cognia Performance Standards for different institution types, you will notice
a significant change: One set of standards now applies to all K–12 and postsecondary institution types, including
systems of institutions. All education institutions share a fundamental common goal: to inspire and equip learners
so that they succeed to their highest potential. The research-based standards acknowledge that commonality.
They are appropriate for all institutions, placing emphasis on quality and effective practices that benefit all
learners in any K–12 or postsecondary non-degree granting setting. The details relevant to different types of
institutions will be addressed in assurances and in other Cognia Accreditation resources that will be available
to members. (Early Learning, Extended Learning, Education Service Organizations including Charter School
Authorizes, and State Education Agencies continue to have dedicated standards.)
Our Performance Standards for 2022–2028 are designed to evolve the work of the institution to meet current
and future educational contexts. First, the standards are constructed with a learner-centered focus. Historically,
accreditation standards are institutionally centered, describing the processes and performance of the institution.
Our standards focus on the learner and how all the processes and practices serve to support and ensure the
learner’s journey of learning.
Additionally, the standards require that institutions define the needs of each learner and what it will take for
the learner to succeed in their educational journey. The institution must ensure that each learner has access
to effective teaching, the entire school’s curriculum and programming, and additional support services when
needed. The institution also must ensure that the school’s curriculum and programming is inclusive of every
learner. No learner should be excluded based on their background or demographic footprint. Fundamental
to meeting the needs of every learner is that the institution believes that every learner can succeed in their
educational journey and commits to actions aligned with that belief.
Every iteration of Cognia’s Performance Standards builds on the prior version to support ongoing improvement.
Many of the themes of the previous standards are reflected in the new standards. The standards also include
several significant new concepts to guide institutions forward, including:
• Learner-centric: Cognia’s new standards focus on the learner, describing the impact on the learning
journey of processes and practices, which reflect the performance of the institution. Further, the standards
emphasize student agency.
• Learner well-being: Learning depends on more than skilled instruction. Institutions must address multiple
aspects of learners’ circumstances and environments, so that every learner can grow.
• Inquiry-based approach: Action research fosters inquiry and dialogue among educators, guiding informed
improvements to instructional practices.
40
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Rubrics
Each Cognia Performance Standard is rated using a four-point rubric. These rubrics embed the identified
practices that institutions and systems should have in place. Level 4 of each rubric identifies the demonstration
of noteworthy systematic and systemic practices producing clear results that positively impact learners, while
Level 1 reflects areas with insufficient evidence and/or limited activity leading toward improvement.
The institution and the Engagement Review evaluators will use these rubrics for rating each of the 31 standards.
The expectation is that Level 3 represents meeting the standard, with Level 4 going well above and beyond the
expected practice at Level 3. Levels 1 and 2 represent practices that don’t yet meet the intent of the standard.
Cognia uses a compensatory methodology for rating the standards. Put simply, that means that your institution
may meet most but not all the criteria in a particular rubric level and still achieve that rating. Think of it as “we
have evidence for criterion 1 and criterion 2, but minimal evidence for criterion 3; however, there is other evidence
that compensates for criterion 3,” as opposed to “we must meet criterion 1 AND criterion 2 AND criterion 3 to
earn the rating.” As you examine the rubric for each standard, you will see words that differentiate between
the levels, moving from practices that “rarely” or “seldom” occur in Level 1, to “occasionally” or “sometimes”
being in place in Level 2, to “regular,” “systematic,” and “routine” implementation in Level 3, and “consistent” and
“systemic” practices in Level 4. Both Level 3 and Level 4 include the expectation that your institution’s evidence
will demonstrate that processes are in place and will show the results that have been achieved through the
implementation of the processes. Rely on Cognia’s definitions, not dictionary definitions, for these words that
differentiate (available in the Cognia Glossary). The overarching definitions for each of the four levels are as follows:
Rubric Level Descriptors
Level 4
Demonstrating noteworthy systematic and systemic practices producing clear results that positively
impact learners.
Level 3 Engaging in practices that provide evidence of expected effectiveness that is reflected in the standard.
Level 2
Developing or improving practices that provide evidence that effort approaches desired level of
effectiveness.
Level 1 Reflecting areas with insufficient evidence and/or limited activity leading toward improvement.
How to Unpack the Standards
Review each of the 31 standards cards by reading the selected standard and examining the elements associated
with the standard. You will see the elements align with the rubric levels in the four-point rubric for the standard. For
each standard, you will also see key terms identified that reflect concepts within the standard and elements.
As you conduct your Self-Assessment with your institution leadership team and other stakeholders, you will
want to identify evidence your institution may already have to demonstrate the institution’s performance for
the standard. You will also likely find some standards where you need to collect additional evidence to achieve
a higher rating on the rubric. Prioritize evidence by reviewing the earlier section on engaging in the process of
continuous improvement and effective use of data. This will help you identify the most impactful evidence to
support your rating for each standard.
This will take time and discussion within your institution community and is a major component of the Self-
Assessment process. It is critical that you provide adequate time for group discussions to review sources of
evidence, synthesize and analyze data, and use these sources to help you decide on a rubric level rating for each
standard. As you identify the rating for each standard for your institution, be prepared to cite specific reasons
and evidence used to reach that rating. This will support you in compiling the narrative responses to each key
characteristic in the next section.

Key Characteristics
There are four key characteristics that are present when institutions effectively and productively tend to the
Performance Standards. In other words, when one walks into an educational institution these key characteristics
are evident. First, you should witness an environment where the culture is focused on the challenges, joys, and
opportunities for learning. Second, one should witness leadership focused, dedicated, and committed to learning.
Third, one should witness learners engaged productively in the learning experience. And lastly, one should have
evidence that learners are growing in their learning in the programs and curricula provided by the institution.
Group Activity: World Café: Deep Dive into the Standards
Definitions
Here are the four key characteristics you will address with brief definitions of each characteristic:
Culture of Learning. A good institution nurtures and sustains a healthy culture of learning. In a healthy culture,
learners, parents, and educators feel connected to the purpose and work of the institution as well as behave
in alignment with the stated values and norms. The institution also demonstrates evidence that reflects the
mission, beliefs, and expectations of the institution (e.g., learners’ work; physical appearance of the institution;
participation in institution activities; family attendance at institution functions).
Leadership for Learning. The ability of a leader to provide leadership for learning is a key attribute of a good
school. Leaders who engage in their own learning while tangibly supporting the learning process for learners
and teachers have a significant positive impact on the success of others. Leaders must also communicate
continuously with consistency and purpose the learning expectations for all learners and teachers. The
expectations are embedded in the culture of the school reflective in learners’, teachers’, and leaders’ attitudes and
behaviors about learning.
Engagement of Learning. A good institution ensures that learners are engaged in the learning environment.
Learners who are engaged in the learning environment participate with confidence and display agency over their
own learning. A good institution adopts policies and engages in practices that support all learners being included
in the learning process.
Growth in Learning. A good institution positively impacts the learner throughout their journey of learning. A
positive impact on the learner is reflected in their readiness to engage in and preparedness for the next transition
in their learning. Growth in learning is also reflected in the learner’s ability to meet expectations in knowledge and
skill acquisition.
All the Performance Standards are related to one or more of these characteristics, based on the unique context
of the institution. Performance Standards have been assigned a primary and secondary key characteristic that
Cognia feels they most closely align with, however your institution may see the standards connecting to the key
characteristics in different ways based on your context.
How to Write the Key Characteristic Narratives
You will use all the information from your analyses of data and your self-rating of the standards and assurances
to inform your key characteristics narratives. Using what you have learned from your rating of the standards,
including the evidence you have listed, you will create a narrative discussing the status of each key characteristic
at your institution. The following tips, along with the example narratives, can help you to write narratives that
represent your institution well and provide needed information to the Engagement Review evaluators.
• Write in complete sentences.
• Cite the standards numbers when appropriate at the end of sentences.
• Address all the prompts provided.

Key Characteristic 2: Leadership for Learning
The ability of a leader to provide leadership for learning is a key attribute of a good institution. Leaders who
engage in their own learning while tangibly supporting the learning process for learners and teachers have a
significant positive impact on the success of others. Leaders must also communicate the learning expectations
for all learners and teachers continuously with consistency and purpose. The expectations are embedded in the
culture of the institution, reflected by learners’, teachers’, and leaders’ behaviors and attitudes toward learning.
Keys to Leadership for Learning
Leadership for learning is demonstrated when school leaders:
• Communicate expectations for learning
• Influence and impact the culture in positive ways
• Model and engage in learning while supporting others to do so

Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Here is an example:
Sample Areas of Excellence
Upon reviewing the standards and reflecting upon the key characteristics discussed in the narrative statements
above, the leadership team has identified the following areas of excellence: commitment to our vision and
mission, a focus on building the capacity of faculty and staff, and allocation of resources to support the needs of
faculty and students.
At our school, you will find that the mission and vision of the school are immersed and modeled throughout
the school community, from our main office to our staff workroom to our classrooms. It would be difficult
to identify a student, teacher, parent, or administrator who does not know our vision and mission. These
statements, developed, approved, and annually reviewed by the stakeholders, represent all facets of our school
community and are the mainstay of our daily operations, embedded in the culture of the school. Our mission is
the educational framework designed to achieve the highest possible academic outcomes. References to the
mission and vision are constant and seamless. You will find our vision and mission statements are used as the
North Star in making decisions related to curriculum selection, assessment practices, hiring practices, and
decisions regarding finances. Everything we do connects back to the vision and mission.
As noted in our narrative statement, a focus on building capacity of faculty and staff is another identified
area of excellence. Professional learning is a vital component of the school’s dynamic, progressive approach
to teaching and learning. We have worked to ensure that we not only provide the necessary training to our
faculty members, but we also afford the necessary time and support for our teachers to implement strategies
with fidelity. We are intentional in monitoring the results of implementation and adjusting as needed. The
positive academic outcomes and increased engagement we have been able to attain (as noted in our narrative
statements) by providing our instructional faculty with professional learning opportunities is our evidence of
this.
A final area of excellence that we have identified is the allocation of resources to support the needs of
our faculty members and students. Our school provides a plethora of resources. Among them are Google
Classroom (as a Learning Management System), Naviance (for college and career planning), Khan Academy,
and Study Island (both for remediation, enrichment, and individualization of learning). We feel that the allocation
and use of resources to support the school’s mission and vision merits recognition for its ability to provide
abundant resources for teaching and learning. We feel the importance of human, material and fiscal resources
should never be underestimated in striving to move our school and our students to the next level of academic
excellence.
85
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Sample Areas for Improvement
Our school relies heavily on the use of Cognia culture and climate surveys, teacher inventories, and the
eleot observation tool to determine areas for improvement at the school. Based on analyzed data, student
performance on state and local assessments, and stakeholder input, the site council has determined that
several areas for improvement are a priority for the upcoming school year.
First, student performance is one of our highest priorities. Performance on the state assessments has recently
plateaued in the areas of English and science, and while performance on math assessments is relatively high
compared to state averages, there is always room for improvement. Continuing the school’s focus on reliable
intervention for struggling students is a priority, as well as addressing the course maps in English and Science to
increase rigor and align more closely to the state standards.
Secondly, our professional development plan will need to increase time devoted to pedagogical skills,
particularly on student engagement and formative assessment. Observation data indicate that while students
are respectful and well behaved, they are often more compliant than actively engaged. If we coach our teaching
staff on how to actively engage learners in meaningful ways, learner outcomes will improve.
Next, the leadership team has prepared an incentive plan for student and staff attendance. With the uncertainty
of recent times, many students and staff members have accrued many absences. While safety is of paramount
concern, the leadership team wants to make sure learners are present, staff are present, and the school does
not have to rely on substitutes. To this end, several incentive programs have been proposed, although none
have been accepted or finalized at this point.
Finally, our school is actively engaged in recruiting talented teachers and leaders of underrepresented groups.
We want all students to have role models and advocates that accurately reflect our student demographics.
By actively working with local and national recruiting agencies, we hope to recruit outstanding educators and
increase the overall diversity of our school.
Working collaboratively with all stakeholders, our leadership team believes it can leverage the experience,
knowledge, and enthusiasm of the community to improve the educational experience for all learners.
Sample Challenges
While our school endeavors to provide the highest educational experience possible for all learners, there
have been and still are some challenges the leadership team is trying to overcome through collaboration,
determination, and focused professional development.
The first major challenge has been the transition from on-site learning to remote learning, then back to onsite
learning. Logistically, the major hurdles were worked out at the first transition—every student was issued
a laptop and all teachers were given a professional Zoom account to conduct classes. However, in-person
learning is significantly different than online learning. The school did not have the capacity or professional
knowledge to instruct staff members on best practices for online learning. With time and experience,
the professional learning communities (PLCs) for teachers came up with many researched and effective
techniques; however, there has been precious little time to implement or even gauge the effectiveness because
of the ongoing transitions and changes.
Based on recent assessment data, a second challenge is mastery. Our students have not fully mastered the
curriculum standards for their classes. End-of-course results from the locally developed assessments indicate
large gaps in performance from previous years, partially attributable to lost classroom time, adjustment to
remote learning, and stress. The leadership team is working cooperatively with teachers and counselors to set
up appropriate intervention strategies and make the counselors available for students and staff members who
are experiencing anxiety about the current issues.
Finally, our most recent challenge has been restarting and maintaining our facilities at the proper level of
hygiene after so many months of unuse. Our primary concern must be for the safety of all learners and staff
members, so these adjustments are a necessary part of the process. While it takes extra time, funding, and
effort, we are confident that we can overcome these challenges.

Assurances
The Cognia Assurances are compliance-oriented requirements of all accredited institutions. The assurances are
comprised of requirements applicable to all systems and institutions and, in some cases, supplemented by any
additional requirements unique to the system or institution type. Also, some institutions may have specialized
assurances related to the institutions or to requirements of partnership agreements. Institutions are expected to
meet the required assurances and are expected to correct any deficiencies in unmet assurances.
Special note regarding the first assurance: The first assurance verifies that your institution complies with all
Cognia policies and procedures. When your Engagement Review occurs, evaluators will ask questions related to
the policies and procedures. A best practice is to identify for the evaluators someone in your institution who will
answer policy and procedure related questions.
The first seven assurances are the same for every institution type; however, each institution type may have
additional assurances. The Assurances for Schools and Systems in the United States are listed in the section
below. Assurances and activities for all other types of institutions are listed in the Appendices to this workbook.
While the statements are clear, Cognia has provided definitions and explanations where they are needed. Be
prepared to provide evidence for each assurance that shows your institution meets the requirement. Select your
institution type below to see the assurances that apply to your institution.
Below you will click the link for the assurances appropriate to your institution, then read each assurance and mark
“Yes” if your institution meets the assurance or “No” if your institution does not meet the assurance. Below the
list of assurances, list any assurances marked “No” and describe your plan of action to bring your institution into
compliance.

The Engagement Review
The information below provides a general understanding of the purpose and functions of the Accreditation
Engagement Review. Your institution has the support of your local Cognia office and the Regional Accreditation
Evaluator (for U.S. reviews) or the Lead Evaluator (for International reviews), should you have questions.
U.S. Reviews
Reviews are no longer conducted as an event with a team coming on-site for multiple days. Most review
activities will be completed remotely, including review and evaluation of your submitted diagnostics and any
leadership presentations and discussion. If your state requires an on-site component for the review, it will be
completed sometime during the year of the Engagement Review. On-site components include review of learning
environments and document review or discussion with leadership teams.
If your institution is in a state that does not require an on-site component but you would like to request it as part
of your Engagement Review, please contact your Regional Director for consideration, approval, associated
activities, and fees.
During the year of your Engagement Review, you will work closely with your Regional Accreditation Evaluator to:
• Establish any schedule needed for remote activities and any on-site component, as applicable.
• Address any questions and/or concerns related to review preparation.
International Reviews
Some activities, such as stakeholder interviews, will be conducted remotely prior to your on-site review
component. Other activities will continue to be conducted by the review evaluators on-site.
As the Engagement Review timeframe approaches, you will work closely with the Lead Evaluator to:
• Establish the review schedule, including remote activities and the on-site component of the review
• Coordinate logistics for the evaluators
• Address any questions and/or concerns related to review preparation
• Ensure the system and institutions are ready for the on-site review and other activities
The Review Protocol
The protocol for all accreditation reviews includes a self-assessment phase; a third-party peer review and
document review; formal feedback recognizing the noteworthy practices and areas for improvement of the
institution; and a progress reporting phase. These activities happen over the six-year term* of accreditation.
The Engagement Review is no longer a single event, but is a series of activities conducted by the institution and
Cognia to measure the degree to which your institution is engaged in the continuous improvement process.
The specific elements of the self-assessment phase and the activities of the evaluators during the Engagement
Review vary depending on the type of institution being reviewed.
*Note: Some states currently require the continuation of a five-year term of accreditation.

Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Role of the Primary Contact
Often, the leader of the institution assigns a senior staff member to facilitate the accreditation process and act
as a Primary Contact for Cognia and the Regional Accreditation Evaluator (for U.S. institutions) or Lead Evaluator
(for International institutions). This individual:
• Serves as the key point of contact between Cognia and the institution
• Oversees the accreditation management for the institution or system, including working with individual
institutions within the system
• Supports stakeholders throughout the process, answers questions, and provides guidance
• Works with the evaluator to prepare for and complete the Engagement Review
• Manages the logistics and oversees the schedule of Engagement Review activities
Key Responsibilities of Systems and Institutions
The following table outlines the responsibilities of your institution throughout the six-year accreditation cycle.

Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Using Diagnostics and Tools
Cognia’s intent is for your institution to use appropriate tools for the diagnosis of your continuous improvement
process. Your analysis of the results of these diagnostics will be critical not only to your ongoing improvement
process, but also for your Engagement Review.
Your institution should engage in an ongoing internal review to determine the current status of the institution,
including needs, goals, and areas of successful improvement. During your improvement journey, the institution
should focus on collecting and analyzing data concerning (1) perspectives (stakeholder perceptions about your
institution gathered through surveys, interviews, or other techniques), (2) observations of teaching and learning,
and (3) data analysis (ongoing collection, analysis, and use of data, particularly concerning student performance
and organizational effectiveness).
Gathering Stakeholder Perception Data
The purpose and value of surveys is to gain an understanding of what key stakeholders believe about the quality
and experience of schooling. Stakeholder perceptions and experiences reveal how the processes, practices,
and conditions of schooling impact learners, families, and educators. Cognia provides an array of valid and
reliable surveys that an institution can deploy to gather stakeholder perspectives. Institutions may also use
your own surveys or other tools to gather stakeholder perspectives. Whether you use Cognia tools or your own,
the institution must submit an analysis of the survey results and how they are used to guide the institution’s
continuous improvement. You will complete this analysis using the Stakeholder Feedback Analysis, and submit it
to Cognia as part of your completed diagnostics prior to the Engagement Review.

Observing Teaching and Learning
Cognia’s Teacher Observation Tool is a formative tool designed to promote teachers’ improvement toward the
practice of learner-centric instruction and effective teaching. It is designed to be used in remote, synchronous
virtual, hybrid, and face-to-face classroom settings. The tool has 23 items that can be expected to be observed
within a 20-minute observation timeframe, in any subject and grade level. This tool is available to all Cognia
institutions.
Cognia uses three proprietary observation tools for learning, specific to various learning environments.
The Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool (eleot) is a learner-centric classroom observation
tool that focuses on the learners in K–12 classrooms. The eleot is made up of 28 items organized in seven
environments aligned with the Cognia Performance Standards and is based on a review of widely used
observation instruments and the most current research on effective learning. The eleot provides useful, relevant,
structured, and quantifiable data on the extent to which learners are engaged in activities and/or demonstrate
knowledge, attitudes, and/or dispositions that are conducive to effective learning. This tool is available to all
institutions.
The Environmental Rating for Early Learning (erel™) is a classroom observation tool that examines researchbased
elements of effective early learning classroom environments. The erel is organized into four environmental
domains that examine practices and behaviors of both children in the environment and the adult influence on the
environment. The tool includes 66 items that are observed in a 30- to 45-minute observation timeframe, looking
96
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
at both the indoor and outdoor learning environments. The purpose of this tool is to identify and document
observable evidence of essential environmental requirements that are conducive to the health, safety, and
education of young children. This tool, currently offered in an offline version, is available to all institutions upon
request.
The Cognia Observation Tool for Digital Learning is an end-user observation tool that focuses on the digital
learning environment and associated learning experiences. The observations are conducted from the end-user
perspective to measure the alignment level of the environment and experiences to research-based criteria
and best practices in digital learning. The tool measures five Key Areas using 23 criteria and a two-dimensional
analysis for a holistic approach. The tool is utilized for various settings including asynchronous, synchronous,
instructor-led, self-paced, 100% virtual, or blended models of instruction. The tool is currently offered in a digital
or offline version and available to all institutions upon request.
Conducting observations of teaching and learning is a valuable part of the continuous improvement process.
Cognia has traditionally examined learner engagement while conducting classroom observations during reviews,
using the eleot. As part of your Self-Assessment phase, you will conduct and analyze classroom observations
in preparation for the Engagement Review, with a focus on learner engagement. In most U.S. reviews, Cognia
will no longer conduct formal classroom observations unless required by state approvals. Instead, your learning
environment observations and analysis will provide Cognia evaluators with information on how well learners are
engaged in your institution. International reviews will still have some classroom observations conducted by the
evaluators.
You are encouraged to have staff become certified in the eleot and use that tool to conduct your classroom
observations. Each institution’s network membership includes three training seats for eleot certification each
year. If you have an existing classroom observation tool that focuses on learner engagement, you are welcome to
continue using that tool for your observations and analysis in place of the eleot. Many institutions have found the
regular use of observations helpful as sources of evidence for standards related to teaching and learning as well
as to gauge the effectiveness of continuous improvement initiatives such as professional development related
to instructional practice and learner engagement. We encourage you to use the observation tools available to
your institution to support your own examination of teaching and learning and as evidence of progress on related
initiatives.

Analyzing Student Performance Data
Implementing a Balanced Assessment System helps educators gain a full picture about what learners know and
can do, which assists in educational decision making to improve academic learning and program effectiveness.
Institutions need to collect, analyze, and synthesize performance data in order to fully understand how learners
are progressing, where there are gaps, and whether curriculum and instruction is effective.
Cognia offers formative assessment solutions to support institutions in implementing a Balanced Assessment
System that supports assessment for learning.
97
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Formative assessment is a multi-step interactive process in which learners and educators engage in instructional
activities, gather evidence of learning, and use feedback to adjust teaching and improve learning in real time.
Cognia offers formative item sets to assist educators in grades K–12 across Mathematics, English Language Arts,
Science, and Social Studies. Cognia Formative Assessments allow classroom teachers to gather evidence of
academic learning aligned with Common Core State Standards and learning targets. These are available as PDF
item sets in the Cognia online platform for all institutions.

Developing the Schedule of Activities
The institution’s leader or designee (whom Cognia refers to as the Primary Contact) works with the Regional
Accreditation Evaluator (for U.S. institutions) or Lead Evaluator (for International institutions) to schedule all
needed review activities. Engagement reviews are conducted through a mix of remote activities prior to the
on-site component and the on-site portion of the review. Review activities and scheduling vary depending on
location. Please see the information below for your institution. Click here to view information for U.S. institutions.
Click here to view information for International institutions.
U.S. Reviews
Most U.S. reviews will be conducted through a review of the evidence and analyses your institution submits. The
Regional Accreditation Evaluator will work with you to schedule leadership presentations and discussions as
needed. For states requiring an on-site component for the review, the evaluator will schedule this at any point
in the year of the review, typically in the fall or winter of the academic year. All other review activities will be
conducted remotely at times convenient to you and the evaluator.
Leadership Presentation
Your Regional Accreditation Evaluator will schedule a leadership presentation with you to expand on information
shared in your submitted Self-Assessment diagnostics. The leadership presentation should begin with a brief
overview of the institution community and demographics (approximately five minutes) and then address the
following questions:
• What are the current strategic priorities and/or key goals for the institution?
• What data was used to identify the priorities and goals?
• How are you addressing these priorities and goals?
• What results do you have that measure your progress in meeting these priorities and goals?
The leader’s overview should last no more than 30 minutes. It is helpful to provide the evaluator with a copy of the
leader’s comments (slide deck or notes) for reference.
Evidence Review
The Regional Accreditation Evaluator assigned to your institution will spend a great deal of time reviewing and
evaluating evidence provided by your institution. Therefore, it is imperative that your required documents are
uploaded to Workspace in the Cognia Improvement Platform no later than four weeks prior to the scheduled
leadership presentation. The date of submission is determined and scheduled by Cognia..
Your evaluator may contact the Primary Contact or institution leader to ask for additional specific documents
based on findings from observations (as applicable) and review of submitted evidence. This does not mean you
did not provide adequate information. In some cases, it simply means additional documentation is needed to
verify, through multiple sources, that certain activities or practices are in place.

Stakeholder Interviews (as needed)
Since you are providing in-depth analysis of stakeholder feedback gathered by your institution as part of your
Self-Assessment process, Cognia is no longer requiring stakeholder interviews as part of the Engagement
Review process. The purpose of your stakeholder feedback analysis is to gather information from a variety
of stakeholders about their collective perceptions of your institution and then make decisions about your
continuous improvement efforts based on that feedback in conjunction with other data sources. Your evaluator
will work with you to determine what stakeholder interviews are applicable to your Engagement Review. If needed,
stakeholder interviews will be conducted remotely via Zoom. Group interviews will take approximately 45 minutes
while individual interviews will take approximately 15 minutes, with the exception of interviews with individual
board members and the head of the institution (e.g., superintendent, principal, or chief executive officer)..
Selecting Interviewees (as applicable, in consultation with your evaluator)
The following guidelines are designed to help with inviting stakeholders to be interviewed, if applicable. Before
proceeding with invitations, please confirm the interview groups with your evaluator.
• Stakeholders should collectively reflect the institution’s broader community (socioeconomic levels, race and
ethnicity, and geographic areas served by the institution).
• Provide a range of viewpoints and perspectives (strong and active supporters, critics, those who are less
involved, etc.).
• Include families and community members who are not employed by your institution.
• Represent all levels and departments in the institution.
• Represent all major categories of positions in the institution (leadership, administrative, teaching, guidance,
and support functions).
• Include individuals who can discuss the institution’s strengths and challenges.
The overarching considerations when identifying stakeholders to be interviewed are:
• Will the stakeholders collectively provide an accurate assessment of the institution? Will the stakeholders
collectively yield information that will prove valuable to the institution in its continuous improvement efforts?
• While it may be tempting to identify only those stakeholders who are active and strong supporters of the
institution, that approach will not maximize the insights and richness of the findings that can ultimately benefit
the institution’s improvement efforts. Therefore, Cognia recommends a random selection of participants.
Observations (as applicable, in consultation with your evaluator)
Most U.S. reviews will not have an on-site component to the review unless required by state approvals. Since
you are providing in-depth analysis of learning environment observations gathered by your institution as part of
your Self-Assessment process, Cognia is no longer requiring classroom observations as part of the Engagement
Review process. The purpose of your Learning Environment Observation Analysis is to collect information
about the learner experience and learner engagement in your institution and then make decisions about your
continuous improvement efforts based on those observations in conjunction with other data sources. All
observations should be conducted by trained observers certified in the observation tool being used. Cognia
recommends you use the applicable Cognia observation tools, as your membership provides you with access to
these tools and eleot certifications for up to three staff annually.
Your evaluator will work with you to determine whether any classroom observations are applicable to your
Engagement Review. If an on-site component to the review is applicable to your institution, an evaluator will
observe throughout the institution. These observations may include formal observations of learning environments
using the eleot and/or other tools and informal observations around the institution. The Primary Contact should
notify teachers that the evaluator may observe their classrooms during the on-site portion of the review. The
institution leader and/or Primary Contact should explain the purpose of these observations, emphasizing that the
99
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
evaluator is observing learner engagement in the institution, not evaluating teachers. Evaluators are instructed to
be as unobtrusive as possible and to not disrupt the learning process. Teachers should conduct class as usual.
General Observations Around the Institution
In addition to the classroom observations, the evaluator may conduct informal observations throughout your
institution. This may include system-level areas, resource rooms, media centers and technology labs, outdoor
environments, and interactions in non-instructional environments such as hallways or the cafeteria. These
general observations provide data regarding the overall culture and climate of the institution.
Expenses (as applicable for any on-site components)
Your institution is responsible for all expenses related to the on-site component of the review, if required for your
institution. Expenses may include hotel accommodations, airfare and mileage, if applicable, and other incidental
costs associated with the on-site component (e.g., meals). Reimbursement for mileage is based on the current
standard mileage rate published by the United States Internal Revenue Service.
The Accreditation fee is assessed once every six years and covers associated costs for the full six-year term *
of accreditation, including mandatory training for institution personnel, the Engagement Review, the Progress
Report, and ongoing resources and support for your continuous improvement journey.
*Note: Some states currently require the continuation of a five-year term of accreditation.
Lodging
Your institution is responsible for securing and paying for hotel accommodations, if applicable, in consultation
with the evaluator. The evaluator will work with you to finalize the dates for accommodations.

Sample Engagement Review Schedule for International Schools
Leadership Presentation
Your Lead Evaluator will schedule a leadership presentation with you prior to the on-site portion of the review
to expand on information shared in your submitted Self-Assessment diagnostics. The leadership presentation
should begin with a brief overview of the institution community and demographics (approximately five minutes)
and then address the following questions:
• What are the current strategic priorities and/or key goals for the institution?
• What data was used to identify the priorities and goals?
• How are you addressing these priorities and goals?
• What results do you have that measure your progress in meeting these priorities and goals?
The leader’s overview should last no more than 30 minutes for institutions and 45 minutes for systems. It is helpful
to provide the Lead Evaluator with a copy of the leader’s comments (slide deck or notes) for reference.
Evidence Review
The Accreditation Engagement Review evaluators assigned to your system or institution will meet multiple
times in advance of the on-site portion of the Engagement Review. The purpose of these meetings is to review
processes and procedures for the review, and to discuss evidence provided by your institution. Therefore, it
is imperative that your required documents, including the Executive Summary, Standards Self-Assessment,
Assurances, Stakeholder Feedback Analysis, Student Performance Analysis, Learning Environment Observation
Analysis, and Accreditation Portfolio, are uploaded at least four weeks before the on-site portion of the
Engagement Review.
Your Lead Evaluator may contact the Primary Contact or institution leader to ask for additional specific
documents before the on-site portion of the review. Once the on-site portion of the review begins, the Lead
Evaluator may ask for additional documentation based on findings from interviews and observations. This does
not mean you did not provide adequate information beforehand. In some cases, it simply means additional
documentation is needed to verify, through multiple sources, that certain activities or practices are in place.
101
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Stakeholder Interviews
The purpose of stakeholder interviews is to provide an opportunity for the Engagement Review evaluators to
gather information from a variety of stakeholders about their collective perceptions of your institution. Your
Lead Evaluator will work with you to determine what stakeholder interviews are applicable to your Engagement
Review and when and where individual and group interviews will take place. Interviewees may include institution
leadership and improvement teams, educators, families, community members, support staff, and learners. Most
stakeholder interviews will be conducted remotely via Zoom within the weeks prior to the on-site portion of the
Engagement Review. Your Lead Evaluator will work with you to determine mutually agreeable times for each
stakeholder group to be interviewed.
Setting Up Interviews
The Primary Contact, with support from the institution leadership team, invites and schedules stakeholders
to be interviewed remotely via Zoom as part of a group or individually by Engagement Review evaluators
prior to the on-site portion of the review. However, be aware that evaluators may also choose to conduct brief,
impromptu individual or small group interviews with learners, staff, families, and even visitors to your institution.
Group interviews will take approximately 45 minutes while on-site. Individual interviews will take approximately
15 minutes, with the exception of interviews with individual board members and the head of the institution (e.g.,
superintendent, principal, or chief executive officer).
Interviews begin with a brief overview of the purpose of the interviews and the role of the Engagement Review
evaluator(s). The interview will focus on questions and discussions about the work of the institution.
Selecting Interviewees
The following guidelines are designed to help with inviting stakeholders to be interviewed, if applicable. Before
proceeding with invitations, please confirm the interview groups with your Lead Evaluator.
• Stakeholders should collectively reflect the institution’s or system’s broader community (socioeconomic
levels, race and ethnicity, and geographic areas served by the institution).
• Provide a range of viewpoints and perspectives (strong and active supporters, critics, those who are less
involved, etc.).
• Include families and community members who are not employed by your institution.
• Represent all levels and departments in the institution.
• Represent all major categories of positions in the institution (leadership, administrative, teaching, guidance,
and support functions).
• Include individuals who can discuss the institution’s strengths and challenges.
The overarching considerations when identifying stakeholders to be interviewed are:
• Will the stakeholders collectively provide an accurate assessment of the institution for the Engagement
Review? Will the stakeholders collectively yield information that will prove valuable to the institution in its
continuous improvement efforts?
• While it may be tempting to identify only those stakeholders who are active and strong supporters of the
institution, that approach will not maximize the insights and richness of the findings that can ultimately benefit
the institution’s improvement efforts. Therefore, Cognia recommends a random selection of participants.
Observations
During the on-site portion of the Engagement Review, evaluators will observe throughout the institution. These
observations may include formal observations of learning environments using a Cognia observation tool and
informal observations around the institution.
102
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Classroom Observations
Most institution types will conduct your own formal classroom observations to provide a representation of age/
grade levels, subjects, and environments as part of your Self-Assessment process. You will submit an analysis of
the learner engagement observed during classroom observations through the Learning Environment Observation
Analysis. During the on-site portion of the review, the evaluators may conduct formal or informal classroom
observations to validate your analysis findings. All classroom observations conducted by evaluators will leverage
Cognia observation tools. In digital learning institutions, the Cognia Observation Tool for Digital Learning may be
used by the evaluators to validate the effectiveness of the digital learning environment.
If you have already used eleot or other Cognia observation tools as a data collection tool for your Self-
Assessment, include the results and analyses of your observations in your Learning Environment Observation
Analysis. The evaluators will use your results, as well as their own observations, to corroborate information
obtained from interviews, artifacts, and student performance data.
The Primary Contact should notify teachers that the evaluators may observe their classrooms during the onsite
portion of the review. The institution leader and/or Primary Contact should explain the purpose of these
observations, emphasizing that the evaluators are observing processes and activities in the institution, not
evaluating teachers. Evaluators are instructed to be as unobtrusive as possible and to not disrupt the learning
process. Teachers should conduct class as usual.
General Observations Around the Institution
In addition to the classroom observations, evaluators will conduct informal observations throughout your
institution. This may include system-level areas, resource rooms, media centers and technology labs, outdoor
environments, and interactions in non-instructional environments such as hallways or the cafeteria. These
general observations provide data regarding the overall culture and climate of the institution.
Professional Deliberations
The evaluators engage in professional deliberations regarding the data collected through interviews,
observations, and evidence throughout the review. Cognia asks that these sessions not be interrupted or have
institution personnel or volunteers present. Several of these evaluator deliberations will occur prior to the on-site
portion of the review as the evaluators engage in evidence review and stakeholder interviews. While on-site, the
evaluators will also meet to engage in professional deliberations. The evaluators use diagnostic tools to engage
in professional deliberations regarding your institution’s adherence and commitment to the Cognia Performance
Standards. These deliberations support the ongoing improvement journey of the institution through the
presentation of the findings and the Engagement Review Report.
Concluding Meeting with Head of Institution
When the evaluators finish their deliberations and determine findings, the Lead Evaluator meets with your Head of
Institution and any staff members the Head of Institution designates to participate in the meeting. The Concluding
Meeting will be scheduled within a week following the on-site portion of the review, but will usually not happen
the same day the evaluators are on-site. The Primary Contact schedules the meeting time and location at the
conclusion of the on-site portion of the review and ensures all participants are informed of the meeting. The
meeting provides an opportunity for the Lead Evaluator to discuss the findings with your institution’s leadership,
answer questions, and address any concerns.
103
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Coordinating Review Logistics
Your leader and Primary Contact are responsible for coordinating the logistics for the review with the Lead
Evaluator. The following checklists can help with this task.
At least six weeks prior to the on-site portion of the Engagement Review:
• Coordinate morning and evening transportation for the evaluators to and from the institution and other
locations as needed for each day of the review. For evaluators who may be flying in, please coordinate any
transportation arrangements from the airport to the hotel upon arrival and transportation back to the airport
for departure.
• Secure hotel room reservations for each evaluator, if applicable.
• Make all meal arrangements for the evaluators for each day of their stay (and coordinate any necessary
details for meal delivery). For reviews requiring overnight stays, selecting a hotel with an included breakfast in
the room rate is a simple option to handle breakfast. During system reviews, evenings will be spent in working
meetings at the hotel, so having dinner delivered to the meeting room is helpful.
• Work with your Lead Evaluator to determine if evening meetings at the hotel will be needed. If so, reserve
meeting space at the hotel each night of the review. The meeting room should be organized as a hollow
square, with enough chairs to accommodate all evaluators. Reliable internet access, a screen, LCD projector,
power cords (two to three), flip chart paper (at least one full pad), markers (at least one for every evaluator),
masking tape, and sticky notes (standard square size, at least one pad for each evaluator) should be
provided. Water and light refreshments are appreciated.
• Invite interviewees for stakeholder interviews to be conducted prior to the on-site portion of the review.
• Make name badges for evaluators, including any security clearances needed, and ensure that institution
personnel wear their name badges.
• Please note that evaluators are not allowed to accept gifts from the institution. Items of nominal value such
as pens, pads, or other items with or without the institution’s logo, that will assist the evaluators with their work
are acceptable. Please refer to Cognia Policy 2.7(b).
At least four weeks prior to the on-site portion of the Engagement Review:
• Complete the Assurances Diagnostic and upload with any supportive documentation, including your license
to operate.
• Complete and upload the Standards Self-Assessment, Executive Summary, Stakeholder Feedback Analysis,
Student Performance Analysis, and Learning Environment Observation Analysis.
• Gather and submit the Accreditation Portfolio, ensuring all documents are accessible to the evaluators at
least four weeks in advance of the evaluators’ arrival.
• Confirm all the details related to the schedule and check in with the Lead Evaluator.
• Ensure that all stakeholders involved in the review have a copy of the Engagement Review schedule.
• Email and/or send a reminder to all interviewees.
• Confirm hotel reservations for the evaluators, if applicable.
• Confirm air and ground transportation arrangements for each evaluator, including special requirements such
as international travel visas, vaccinations, and immigration or entry requirements, if applicable.
• Confirm meals and dinner reservations or delivery for the evaluators.
Expenses
Your institution is responsible for all expenses related to the review, including hotel accommodations, visas for
evaluators, if applicable, and other incidental costs associated with the review (e.g., meals, local transportation
costs). The Accreditation Fee is assessed once every six years and covers associated costs for the full six-
104
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
year term of accreditation, including mandatory training for institution personnel, the Engagement Review, the
Progress Report, and ongoing resources and support for your continuous improvement journey.
Lodging
Your institution is responsible for securing and paying for hotel accommodations, if applicable, in consultation
with the Lead Evaluator. The Lead Evaluator will work with you to finalize the dates for accommodations.
Hosting the Engagement Review Evaluators
Engagement Reviews are scheduled with a mix of remote and on-site activities to ensure the evaluators can
conduct the review with fidelity and gain a full picture of your institution. The Engagement Review schedule serves
as the primary guide for the review. The institution leader and Primary Contact work with the Lead Evaluator
to manage the schedule and ensure all activities of the review occur as planned. The leader and/or Primary
Contact should be available for questions and to help the evaluators access needed information throughout
the review period, both prior to and during the on-site component. It is a good idea for the leader and Primary
Contact to provide their contact information to the evaluators, including cell phone number, and the names and
contact information of other key leadership staff should questions or emergencies arise. Providing the contact
information of a clinic or hospital the institution works with while the evaluators are on-site is also helpful in the
event any evaluator requires medical attention.
Prior to the on-site portion of the review, the evaluators will conduct review activities remotely based on the
schedule the institution leader and the Lead Evaluator have developed. These activities may happen any time in
the four weeks prior to the on-site review component.
On-site Arrival and Orientation
Once the Engagement Review evaluators have arrived for the on-site portion of the review, the Primary Contact
ensures all details unfold as planned.
• Confirm lodging and dinner reservations for the evaluators, if applicable.
• Provide evaluators with hard copies of any information needed for the review, name badges, a final schedule,
maps, floor plans, and any other additional materials evaluators may need.
• If applicable, check to see that the meeting room for the evening meeting(s) is properly set up per the
evaluators’ requirements, which may include internet access, flip charts, sticky notes, markers, masking tape,
LCD projector, power cords, screen, any institution artifacts that the institution wants in the evaluators’ work
room, water, and refreshments.
Below is a sample of activities for an on-site review day.
• Ensure all evaluators have transportation to the institution.
– For system reviews, ensure all evaluators have transportation to the schools selected for on-site reviews.
• Make sure the evaluators’ meeting room at the institution is ready and meets the evaluators’ needs.
• Ensure easy access to the artifacts the evaluators will need.
• Manage the schedule and ensure that all activities stay on schedule.
• Provide lunch for the evaluators or make arrangements for evaluators for lunch at school sites, as applicable.
• Make coffee, water, and light refreshments available throughout the day for the evaluators.
• Provide transportation to and from the hotel, if needed.
105
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Keys to a Successful Review
Systems and institutions that have completed Engagement Reviews offer the following advice to their colleagues:
• Be open and honest with the evaluators. The more authentic and accurate your responses are in your
submitted diagnostics and conversations with the evaluators, the better the evaluators are able to assess the
strengths and needs of the institution.
• Communicate with all stakeholders about the accreditation process. The more people who know
about the accreditation process and the activities for the Engagement Review, the better. Be as open and
transparent about the process as possible.
• Use and refer to the Cognia Performance Standards and rubrics. Connect your evidence and artifacts
to the standards to maximize the evaluators’ time and their ability to provide meaningful feedback to the
institution.
• Share and encourage the evaluators to review specific artifacts. The artifacts that you feel are critical
to the evaluators’ understanding of your institution should be shared in your Accreditation Portfolio.
• Remember that you and your institution will get out of the process what you put into it. Your
institution has the ability, through its own commitment to the process, to make the most of the Engagement
Review process. The more committed the institution is to gaining valuable support and feedback, the more
meaningful the Engagement Review will be as well.
Continuing the Journey
While the majority of this workbook is devoted to the Self-Assessment and Engagement phases of accreditation,
the majority of the institution’s time is spent following the review, acting on the Engagement Review findings and
continuing the improvement journey. This section reviews the key activities that occur on an ongoing basis as you
maintain your processes of continuous improvement.
The Written Report of the Engagement Review
After the conclusion of all review activities and evaluation of submitted diagnostics, your evaluators work to
finalize the written report of the review findings. The report is submitted to Cognia for review and acceptance.
Your institution will receive notification that the final report is available in the Shared Folder in the eProve
Workspace.
Upon receipt of the written report, you should communicate the Engagement Review findings to internal and
external stakeholders. Sharing the results of the review with a wide range of stakeholders helps educate the
broader community about the institution’s accreditation and engagement in continuous improvement. It also
garners stakeholder buy-in with regard to next steps your institution will take to respond to the findings of
the report.
Report Debrief with Head of Institution
Following the review, typically the start of the next academic year, a Cognia representative will schedule a time
to debrief the Engagement Review Report with your leadership team. The meeting provides an opportunity for
Cognia to discuss the findings with your institution’s leadership, answer questions, and address any concerns.
This is also an opportunity to discuss your next steps and any support Cognia might be able to provide as you
engage in continuous improvement.
106
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Notice of Accreditation, Celebrating with the
Community, and the IEQ™
Consistent with the focus of engagement on continuous improvement with an emphasis on student success,
Cognia has introduced an innovative framework for classifying institution performance called the Index of
Education Quality (IEQ). Your institution will receive an IEQ score along with an accreditation status. You will
receive more information about the IEQ after your report has received final approval.
The Cognia Accreditation Office submits the Engagement Review Report to the Cognia Global Commission. The
Cognia Global Commission meets four times per year and acts on all accreditation recommendations. Upon the
conclusion of the meeting, results of the Global Commission’s action will be shared with you. For details regarding
the approval process and future or expected accreditation status, please visit the Policies and Procedures for
Accreditation and Certification.
Upon receiving the official accreditation letter, you should communicate the final results to internal and external
stakeholders. Your institution will receive and should proudly display your certificate of accreditation. Press
releases, flags, Q&A guides, and more are available from Cognia to help systems and institutions share and
celebrate your accreditation with your community.
Practices many systems and institutions find useful include:
• Sharing information about their Engagement Review and the accreditation process with families at every
family meeting and through brochures or handouts
• Displaying the Cognia accreditation seal on institution websites, stationery, and student transcripts
• Posting information about accreditation in a regular column of newsletters
• Including a section on accreditation and its importance in annual reports to the community
Acting on the Engagement Review Findings
The Engagement Review Report will serve as a resource to you as your institution furthers its continuous
improvement efforts. Upon receiving the Engagement Review Report, the institution is encouraged to implement
the following steps:
• Review and share the findings with stakeholders.
• Develop plans to address the Areas for Improvement identified from the Engagement Review. You may also
wish to develop plans to address standards rated at Level 1 or Level 2, if any.
• Use the findings and data from the report to guide and strengthen the institution’s continuous improvement
efforts.
• Celebrate the successes noted in the report.
Be sure to celebrate and strengthen the successes and accomplishments noted in the Engagement Review
Report. Your report may include Noteworthy Practices, which the review found to be practices that are exemplary
and could be a model for other institutions. Make it your goal to build on these accomplishments, enhancing and
sustaining their impact across your institution.
The report will include Areas for Improvement, which are actions identified to address areas where the institution
would benefit from continuous improvement efforts and will support the institution in alignment with your
own goals. Your institution will be held accountable for making progress on each of the identified Areas for
Improvement within three years following the Engagement Review. You will report progress on each Area for
Improvement in a Progress Report that will be submitted to Cognia and returned to you with feedback.
107
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
To begin acting on the review findings, review the full report with institution stakeholders. Spend time discussing
the descriptions of trends and their impact on the institution. These descriptions provide greater clarity, guidance,
and direction.
After you and your team have thoroughly reviewed the Engagement Review findings, you should establish a plan
of action by engaging representative stakeholders in the process. The plan typically outlines next steps related
to the review findings and clear strategies for improving quality, effectiveness, and learning. In addition, your plan
should include implementation strategies and methods for monitoring, documenting, and analyzing results.
Implement the strategies you have selected for responding to the review findings, track the progress your
institution is making, and be prepared to answer the questions: “What steps have been taken? What progress has
been made? How do you know you’ve made an impact?”

Conclusion
Congratulations on your commitment to accreditation and the continuous improvement process. Your
engagement in the continuous improvement process through accreditation will enhance all elements of your
institution. As your understanding of a systemic approach to continuous improvement increases, your institution
will become more effective and efficient as a learner-focused education organization. Your entire institution,
community, and most importantly, learners, benefit as the institution works to improve its systems and processes
to increase effectiveness and enhance learning for learners, educators, and leaders.
Cognia looks forward to supporting you throughout the continuous improvement process.

Executive Summary Sample 3: Red Cedar Tribal School
Red Cedar Tribal School, located in the heart of rural Minnesota, is more than just an educational institution—it’s
a vital part of the community’s cultural fabric. Serving 225 K–12 students across the Red Cedar Reservation, the
school is deeply committed to honoring and preserving the rich traditions of the indigenous population. Over time,
Red Cedar has not only provided basic education to prepare students for college, career, or military readiness,
but has also thoughtfully reimagined its curriculum to reflect the cultural values and practices of the community.
Here, students are immersed in rich learning experiences that prepare them for the future while safeguarding and
revitalizing traditional language, songs, and cultural heritage.
Red Cedar Tribal School serves a rural indigenous community where English is the primary language, with only
a few elders still fluent in the native tongue. Recently, the community has experienced a modest population
increase, partly due to families returning to the reservation during the pandemic to be closer to loved ones, taking
advantage of remote work opportunities. This shift has sparked a renewed emphasis on integrating cultural
education into the school’s curriculum, reflecting a broader trend towards cultural revitalization and strengthening
the bond between the school and the community it serves.
The school operates under the governance of a tribal council, which is distinct from state or federal educational
systems. Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) funds the district and the council acts as the fiduciary. While the school
is primarily answerable to the council, the school is still required to complete some BIE reporting. The council,
elected by the community, provides leadership and strategic direction, ensuring that the school remains aligned
with the cultural values and educational needs of the tribe.
The mission of Red Cedar Tribal School is to provide a holistic education that fosters the academic, cultural,
and spiritual growth of its students. The vision is to empower students to preserve and promote their cultural
heritage while excelling academically. Updated two years ago, the mission and vision now emphasize cultural
education more strongly, reflected in the curriculum’s focus on native language and traditions, and in community
events celebrating cultural heritage. The update involved a collaborative effort with input from students, teachers,
parents, and community members.
Over the past four years, enrollment at Red Cedar Tribal School has remained steady, with a slight increase in
younger students as more families return to the community. The school’s diversity reflects variations in age,
socioeconomic background, and learning levels. Collaborating with the tribal council, the school has ensured
technology access for all families. To meet student needs, the school has adapted its curriculum, offering afterschool
programs that address learning gaps while supporting cultural education.
The school’s philosophy of education is a blend of traditional teaching methods and modern educational theories.
The school emphasizes experiential learning and the importance of social and cultural context in education. The
mission and vision of the school profoundly influence this philosophy, ensuring that students receive an education
that is both academically rigorous and culturally relevant.
Red Cedar Tribal School’s curriculum covers reading, writing, and math, alongside courses in the native language,
history, and tribal traditions. Regular updates, guided by the tribal council and community leaders, keep the
curriculum aligned with the school’s mission and values. By integrating indigenous knowledge and worldviews, the
school ensures students receive a well-rounded education.
Instruction at Red Cedar Tribal School combines traditional teaching, competency-based education, and
technology. Teachers employ culturally responsive methods, including storytelling and hands-on activities, while
technology enhances access to diverse learning resources. Flexible grouping and one-on-one interventions are
used to support individual student needs.
Red Cedar Tribal School prioritizes hiring diverse, qualified educators dedicated to cultural preservation. The
staff includes more tribal members returning to the district and those certified through a grow-your-own initiative.
Regular evaluations uphold high standards in academic and cultural instruction, while the school’s leadership
supports continuous professional development for staff.
135
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
The school regularly assesses student performance in language arts, mathematics, science, and cultural studies.
Performance in cultural subjects is improving, reflecting the school’s strong focus on cultural education. However,
there is room for growth in reading, mathematics, and science, with targeted interventions underway to address
these areas. Trend data shows a drop in performance due to COVID, but recent improvements are emerging in
reading and math, where the school has concentrated its efforts.
Current improvement initiatives at Red Cedar Tribal School include the integration of more advanced technology
into the classroom, the expansion of cultural education programs, and the development of a new community
engagement strategy. These initiatives are in various stages of progress, with the goal of enhancing the overall
educational experience for students and families. Each initiative aligns with the school’s mission and vision,
ensuring that the institution continues to meet the needs of its students and the community.

Schools: Culture of Learning
Evidence:
• Vision/Mission statements
• Primary schedule
• Analyzed Perception Survey results
• Analyzed Culture Survey results
• Analyzed Professional Learning Survey results
• Analyzed enrollment data
• Analyzed attendance results
• Site council records
• Site discipline records
Cooper High School has made great strides in the creation, development, and support for a healthy and impactful
culture amongst the stakeholders that make up our learning community. Leaders at Cooper High School model
behaviors expected from all professional staff and endeavor to maintain a collegial and professional atmosphere
at the school. On August 3, 2023, the leadership team organized a thorough review of the vision and mission of
the school that included parents, teacher leaders, students, staff, and community partners. Utilizing time during
the established professional development schedule, the team analyzed the mission and vision statements and
modified them to reflect the ongoing emphasis of positive relationships, collegiality of professional staff members,
and support for all stakeholders to be successful. After the completion of the team’s work, the leadership team
utilized the Cognia eProve survey platform to select and deploy stakeholder surveys to garner feedback for the
project. An analysis of the survey results by site leaders and staff showed that most stakeholders agreed with
the changes and thought they were aligned with the operations and culture of the school. The highest approval
ratings were from the parents, who emphasized the support programs such as the advisory time to support
connections between peers and staff and classes available to students. The lowest approval ratings were from
the students, whose feedback included a recommendation to include arts and athletics somewhere in the
mission—a recommendation that is being considered for the next review cycle in the spring of 2025.
With the revision of the curriculum for the advisory program, which is scheduled for two periods per week,
teachers have reported in both formal and informal feedback opportunities that students are responding
positively in the sessions and are participating in the scheduled activities with more enthusiasm than the previous
year. The specific survey data analysis included in the Accreditation Portfolio highlights a 3-year growth trend for
this program. Some of the advisory sessions include clear messaging about expected behaviors in the school,
including a clear set of infractions and consequences, but also more trust-building activities that are designed to
bring students together in cooperative projects. On occasion, the advisories are set up for friendly competitions
that involve community service, fundraising, and food drives. Attendance in these programs has increased by
17%, and there have been fewer discipline issues resulting in office referrals during the advisory period. The
leadership team for the advisory program will meet in the spring to formally review the program using surveys,
attendance data, and reflections to continue to move this program forward.
Perceptions of fairness and support among the students and teachers have varied, and the leadership team is
developing a plan to address those concerns. According to the recent climate and culture survey, many students
believe that favorable opportunities and programs are being offered to student athletes and high-performing
students, while many of the students who do not participate in athletics or excel at coursework are ignored or not
given opportunities to feel connected to the school. It is true that student athletes and high-performing students
have assemblies exclusively dedicated to them and their programs, and that incentives for high academic
137
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
performance are common. The leadership team is developing a task force to explore ways of celebrating and
supporting students who have interests outside of the traditional activities and sports so that all students can
shine and be recognized for their individual talents and interests. Additionally, teachers who responded to the
surveys indicated that some of the staff members are frequently asked to participate in both formal and informal
leadership roles while others are rarely given the opportunity to develop leadership skills. The administrative team
believes that they can do a better job offering leadership opportunities to all teachers and will keep track of the
participants in the site council and other school committees so that teachers can feel more connected to the
direction of the school.
Improving overall professional practice amongst staff is prioritized through the professional learning program
and the time allocated for teachers to collaborate on engagement strategies, student performance data,
and collaborative projects that integrate several subject areas. While the full professional learning program is
discussed in a later analysis, the surveys and responses from staff members have been positive and the time
allocated for focused collaboration is appreciated by the teaching staff, as evidenced by the professional learning
surveys.
Based on the findings of the self-analysis, the leadership team at Cooper High School has collaborated with the
school stakeholders to develop the following theories of action. The first theory of action is to support the ongoing
success and strength of the advisory program, while the second theory of action is for growth in recognizing each
and every learner. The third theory of action indicates a need for growth in improving collegiality and providing
opportunities for all staff to develop leadership skills.
1. If the school continues to refine and develop the advisory curriculum to support positive relationships
with peers and staff, then there may be greater opportunities for learners to feel connected to the school.
2. If the school creates opportunities for all learners to highlight their skills and success, then the positive
culture of the school could increase and potentially create a more learner-focused environment.
3. If school leaders develop opportunities for all staff members to take on informal and formal leadership
roles, then there may be greater opportunities for increased collegiality and capacity-building amongst
teachers.
Overall, Cooper High School has a healthy culture that continues to develop and grow. The leadership team
employs many tools such as surveys and observational data to monitor the pulse of the school and make
improvements when warranted. It is the leadership’s goal to continue to improve the healthy culture of the school
by continuing to work proactively for impactful positive results.
Discussion:
The narrative begins with a list of evidence provided to support the observations and Standards related to
Culture of Learning. While this is not a requirement for the narrative, it is added to show that the institution is
leveraging multiple sources of data to support their findings. Note how each of the Culture of Learning Standards
were addressed in the narrative:
1. The narrative addresses Standard 1 through their efforts to support a positive environment for each and
every learner.
2. The narrative addresses Standard 2 through the revision and support of the vision and mission of the
school.
3. The narrative addresses Standard 3 through effective collaboration with stakeholders.
4. The narrative addresses Standard 4 through the evidence related to positive relations between
students and staff members.
5. The narrative addresses Standards 5 and 6 through the need to develop additional opportunities for
staff members to develop capacity and collegiality through formal and informal leadership opportunities
and the allotted time for professional learning.
138
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that the findings include:
1. The strength of the advisory program is increasing.
2. The need for improved opportunities for each and every learner to highlight their talents and skills.
3. The need for all staff members to develop leadership capacity.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect is
developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, they noted that the revision and
strengthening of the advisory program created successful opportunities for stronger relationships. For the
second finding, the narrative highlighted the survey data and the existing programs to support high-achieving
learners and athletes but also mentioned the dearth of opportunity for learners not in those categories. Finally, the
third finding was developed from survey data. Note that each of the theories of action is directly related to these
findings.
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of both
strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings. Note that the institution
included three theories of action – the requirement for the highest rating is only two; however, they included both
required elements of improvement and support of strength.
Schools: Leadership for Learning
Evidence:
• Continuous improvement plan
• Analyzed classroom observation data
• Engagement Review report (2017)
• Site council documentation
• Staff demographics/roster
• Analyzed longitudinal evaluation data (3 years)
• Analyzed teacher/parent/student survey results
• SOP documents
Cooper High School (CHS) is committed to developing leadership at our school that is collaborative, transparent,
and inclusive of our many valued stakeholders. Much of the leadership culture is based on our dedication to
the continuous improvement concept. The school improvement plan was collaboratively designed by the
leadership team, teachers, parents, students, and the governing board. To design the plan, we utilized several
resources, including the previous Cognia Engagement Review Report, data from our last three years of classroom
observation data collected by our instructional coaches, teacher evaluation data summarized from the last
two years of our instructional quality tool used by our governing system, stakeholder surveys, and student
performance data on both summative and formative assessments. Additionally, the system-level strategic plan
was leveraged as a valuable resource so that the school improvement plan would be in alignment with the district
plan. The plan was mapped out for a three-year period and assignments were made for persons responsible and
metrics to be achieved. This plan focuses on sustaining balanced growth in building leadership capacity, elevating
student engagement, and expanding our resources for learning. To support transparency, leaders provide the
school site council, which meets monthly, with a progress report on the current state of the plan. The school
improvement plan embeds both our expectations for learning as well as metrics to help us monitor progress in
meeting those expectations.
The governing board meets twice monthly and the principal of CHS is always present to report on progress,
school issues, and celebrations. The board is working collaboratively with all the schools in the district to uphold
academic standards and learning goals. Because of the earnest support from the district leadership and the
139
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
board, every student in the district was given access to a laptop to accommodate learning when students are
at school and learning at home. Survey results from students and teachers indicate that the process of device
management and safety has been challenging (such as damage to devices, internet safety, and occasional theft)
but also rewarding. Moving forward, our school leadership is identifying which families need additional support for
internet access and laptop training.
To build leadership capacity among the teachers, the leadership team involves teacher leaders by inviting them
to attend the site council and administrative team meetings on a rotating basis. Every teacher who wants a
leadership opportunity is given a chance to participate in school committees and other task-oriented groups.
Currently, 87% of the teaching staff have volunteered to serve on a school committee in a leadership role (up
from 53% three years ago). While there are teachers for whom a leadership role is challenging because of family
commitments and other obligations, school leaders are confident that teachers feel included and valued by
having an opportunity to affect the overall school improvement plan and the outcomes. Teacher surveys support
the idea that most teachers (84%) strongly agree or agree that they feel included and that their voice is heard in
decision making. This sentiment was also confirmed as CHS leaders reviewed the feedback shared by teachers
in two structured focus groups of both new and long-serving staff members. The engagement of all teachers in
the leadership of the school has positively impacted our culture as we truly have a collaborative, transparent, and
shared leadership approach.
Recruitment continues to be a challenge for Cooper High School. Located in a suburban area outside of a major
U.S. city, the school should have access to qualified candidates; however, 48% of the applicants are not formally
certified through accredited colleges and universities and almost 80% of applicants have little or no teaching
experience. To increase the pool of applicants, our leadership team has worked cooperatively with the governing
board to offer financial incentives for qualified candidates to apply for positions. This will hopefully increase
the number of applicants available to choose from and increase the number of experienced applicants. We will
continue to analyze this data over the coming year to see if any changes have resulted from the implementation of
incentives.
The evaluation system for teachers based on the Danielson model was recently updated and approved by the
governing board and includes the elements of goal setting, progress, and classroom observation feedback.
Data from the new evaluation system will be used, in conjunction with Cognia Effective Learning Environments
Observation Tool observations and Cognia Teacher Observation Tool observations to inform future professional
development efforts. We have recently focused professional development on improving teacher skills in distance
learning and making sure students are engaged in online classes when required because of weather conditions
and other factors. The online learning process has been a major hurdle; however, teachers have established PLC
groups to support each other with technical assistance, engagement activities, and online assessment. Leaders
will provide additional opportunities for teachers to continue the PLC process through dedicated time built into
the primary schedule.
Our leadership team has relied on Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for teachers to request materials and
resources for their classrooms. While much of the budget has been dedicated to the online learning program and
resources over the past two years, there are still available resources, albeit scarce, for teachers to personalize
instruction through additional supplementary materials. Requests are made electronically, and every attempt
is made to make timely and objective decisions. To encourage increased leveraging of the available budget, our
leadership team has asked that requests for materials be made as a collaborative decision by teachers in the PLC
groups.
Overall, the leadership culture at Cooper High School is healthy and conducive to growth and collaboration.
While improvements are certainly possible, stakeholders have indicated that the leadership environment is
welcoming, positive, and focused on student achievement. We have seen an increase in teacher participation in
leadership roles within the school as evidenced by the many committees established to support the continuous
improvement plans at each site, and the curriculum review and resource allocation processes are working well
to support teaching and learning. For the curriculum review process, a team of teachers and school leaders
meet on a rotating schedule to analyze curriculum for updates, relevancy, and alignment with state standards.
This process has effectively addressed the need for updated requirements from the state-level accountability
140
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
system and has also fostered a stronger familiarity with learning targets. As noted above, we are continuing to
improve the quality of our candidate pool for teaching and leadership positions. We also look forward to providing
financial resources towards supporting additional professional learning to support individualized interventions
for struggling learners when the heavy investment in online learning and device management moves to a
supplemental approach to instruction. Our leadership team has identified increasing the number of qualified
candidates for teaching roles as a top priority for Leadership for Learning, as well as improving professional
learning in the PLC and online learning processes. Additionally, leaders have identified the program to provide
leadership opportunities as something to continue to support and potentially expand as opportunities become
available and needed. Our theories of action to support continuous improvement are as follows:
1. If we sustain and expand opportunities for teacher leadership, then there may be greater opportunities
for teachers to increase their leadership capacity and strengthen collegiality amongst the professional
staff.
2. If we expand and develop resources and incentives to recruit qualified teaching candidates, then there
may be an expanded pool of candidates available for teaching positions.
Overall, leaders and staff at Cooper High School are dedicated to the ongoing improvement efforts to support
effective growth and sustain strong practices through proactive, impactful, and measurable actions.
Discussion:
The above narrative would be considered exemplary because it addresses the rubric, the writing prompts, and
the Cognia Performance Standards. Note how the narrative addresses the Leadership for Learning Standards:
1. Standard 7 is addressed through the continuous improvement process and includes information on the
sustainability of the plan and process.
2. Standard 8 is addressed through the support of resources by the governing authority and the alignment
of the continuous improvement plan.
3. Standard 9 is addressed through a description of the site council and opportunities for teacher
leadership.
4. Standard 10 and Standard 13 are addressed through an analysis of recruitment and evaluation of staff.
It includes data to support the findings and actions of leadership.
5. Standard 11 is addressed in the description of procedures and processes to sustain strong
organizational practices for resource requests and improving processes related to technology.
6. Standard 12 is addressed by the description of the curriculum review and the ongoing need for cyclical
review and updates.
7. Standard 14 is addressed through a description of both the curriculum review cycle and the support of
learning through technology.
8. Standard 15 is addressed by the analysis of stakeholder needs, professional learning needs, and the
resource request process.
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that two of the findings
include:
1. They need to increase the available pool of candidates for teaching vacancies.
2. The effective leadership development program is successful and can be expanded.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect is
developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, they noted that the pool of available
candidates was limited because of a dearth of formally certified applicants. For the second finding, the narrative
highlighted the survey data and the existing programs to support teacher capacity and leadership. Note also
that while there were other findings in narrative, the leaders focused on two findings to highlight, which meets the
requirements of the Cognia rubric.
141
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of
both strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings. The writing prompts
ask the institution to explain how leaders communicate expectations and monitor progress, how leadership
models desired behaviors, and how leadership is distributed. By focusing on elements of leadership like standard
operating procedures, transparency, and increasing leadership opportunities, the school has effectively
addressed these prompts.
Schools: Engagement of Learning
Evidence:
• Prior AER report
• Professional development plan
• Classroom eleot observation data
• Classroom observation schedule
• Classroom observation feedback/follow-up
• Student perception survey data
• Student attendance data
• Student disciplinary referral data
To approach this analysis, Cooper High School leaders examined each of the Engagement of Learning Standards
and collected and analyzed evidence germane to supporting our ratings. While much progress has been made in
the past three years, there is additional room for growth and improvement.
In reviewing our Accreditation Engagement Review Report from the 2016–2017 school year, we focused heavily
on the review team’s eleot scores and corresponding narrative report regarding the classroom observations that
were conducted. The report indicated that instruction was largely teacher-led, with few opportunities for students
to engage in collaborative discussions with one another or with the teacher. The report also noted that there were
no observations of students participating in active learning opportunities, such as projects, collaborative tasks, or
activities. The findings also indicated that most of the instruction was “one-size-fits all” and there was little or no
evidence of individualization. These findings were consistent with what the Cooper High School Leadership team
observed during informal walk-throughs and formal observations of classroom instruction. As you will see below,
except for Supportive Learning Environments and Well-Managed Learning Environments, all eleot observation
ratings were below 3.0.
142
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Some of the collateral effects of low engagement include a high number of disciplinary referrals, inconsistent
student attendance, and student reports of being “bored” or “disliking school” in the annual surveys distributed to
students. After analyzing the teacher surveys and speaking with focus groups of teachers, leaders believe that the
lack of engaging instruction was not due to a lack of willingness on the part of our faculty/staff. Faculty and staff
regularly sought out professional learning opportunities, but available offerings largely focused on content area or
on how to incorporate technology into instruction. Therefore, we believe the lack of engaging instruction was due
to a lack of professional learning opportunities specifically focused on engagement. To address this issue, over
the last year, the leaders have been deliberate in building teacher capacity for instruction, with a focus on creating
engaging learning environments through the professional learning program. During the 2023–2024 school
year, our quarterly professional development sessions focused on strategies for creating engaging learning
environments. Some examples of the sessions include:
• Differentiated Instruction
• Using Project-Based Learning to Support Student Engagement
• Flipping the Classroom: Approaches to Student-Centered Learning
All core and elective faculty participated in these training sessions. Following each training session, the
instructional coach and other members of the leadership team conducted informal classroom observations to
determine whether the strategies from the training session were being implemented. In cases where strategies
were not being implemented or teachers indicated that they were struggling with implementing strategies, the
instructional coach and leadership team members worked to support faculty by modeling how to implement
the selected strategy/strategies. Leaders also closely monitored data from observations related to learner
engagement to determine to what degree the implementation of these instructional strategies impacted student
engagement of learning and how those strategies might ameliorate some of the negative effects listed above.
Leaders conducted a quarterly review of disciplinary referrals and student attendance, as well as administered
Cognia’s Surveys to gain student’s perception of the school. In addition, the instructional coaches and leadership
team members conducted eleot observations of all core and elective classrooms at the end of each quarter. The
data yielded from these observations show that faculty and staff members’ implementation of strategies from the
professional learning training sessions have had a positive impact. The quarterly data from eleot observations
demonstrate significant increases in all learning environments, but particularly in the areas of Equitable Learning
(average score increased from 2.5 to 3.6), High Expectations (average score increased from 2.3 to 3.5), and
Active Learning (average score increased from 2.4 to 3.8). In a review and discussion of the eleot observation
data, faculty members report that students who were previously disengaged have now been participating with
confidence since the implementation of the new strategies. Faculty members further reported that while they
were initially hesitant to engage in the professional development sessions and did not like having such a high
leadership presence in their classrooms, they now appreciate having the opportunity to build their capacity
because of the results they see in their classrooms. Leaders and teachers have also seen improvements in the
areas of student attendance and student disciplinary referrals. We attribute this to students being more active
and engaged in their learning. Prior to implementing these new strategies, our daily attendance rate was well
below the target of 80%. To date, our daily attendance rate averages over 95%. Disciplinary referrals, which
averaged approximately 100 per week, are now down to 25 per week. As we analyze the student perception
survey data, we surmise that the positive shift in attitude is due to the implementation of classroom practices
focused on engaging the learner. Students now report higher instances of being challenged in their classroom,
doing work that is interesting to them, and having the opportunity to collaborate with their teachers and their
peers.
Despite the success of increased engagement, trend data over the past three years from student surveys show
that learners do not feel like instruction and classroom activities is individualized, nor do they feel they have
much choice in what is learned or how they demonstrate mastery. Many of our teachers have been working on
employing learning strategies to actively engage learners; however, they have not been able to reach a level of
sophistication where learners have choice or individualized options for demonstrating mastery. Overall learner
engagement has increased 17% over the three-year period, and the current year observations show that trend
continuing to increase. Based on the relative success of providing professional learning on active engagement,
143
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
the leadership team feels it necessary to now begin providing professional learning in the two areas of greatest
need: choices for demonstrating mastery and supporting individualized learning. This shift in focus may help
address increasing students’ sense of agency in their learning and provide unique and impactful opportunities to
let learners choose how they are meeting standards.
Where learners are demonstrating strong improvement is in the global skills of collaboration, critical thinking,
and problem-solving. These global learning skills were selected as skills to be applied in all coursework in the
continuous improvement plan. Two years ago, teachers were provided professional learning sessions on how to
provide opportunities for demonstrating these skills in all curricular areas and common language and practices
were shared through the professional learning community sessions. Each teacher provides classroom activities
and scenarios for students to collaborate on solving real-world problems related to their coursework and includes
additional exercises where students must evaluate the practicality and potential success of their solutions. Once
per semester, learners have an open assembly to gallery walk the class projects, answer questions about their
projects, and look at other students’ work. While these sessions are challenging and take a great deal of time
to prepare, learners have responded well to this opportunity and attendance on these days is very high. In the
post-assembly survey, students replied that they like to see other solutions to the real-world problems that are
presented and feel like they “own” their learning when they are asked questions about their projects from their
peers. Leaders have determined that continuing this program is important and based on the feedback intend to
do so, although small changes in how this process is organized and executed may keep the program fresh and
invigorating.
During the pandemic several years ago, Cooper High School created a program to provide each and every learner
with a laptop to use for their coursework. While classes have resumed in person, the program is still in place so
that students can access digital materials and use laptops to support their schoolwork. While very resource
intensive, the laptop program has facilitated greater access to research and information to support learning, and
many teachers reported to have used the availability of the laptops to conduct formative assessments on student
learning so that they have real-time data on how they can reteach or see who needs additional support.
Based on the findings from the above narrative, CHS leaders propose the following theories of action to support
our continuous improvement process:
1. If we focus professional learning on how to differentiate how learners can demonstrate mastery, then
learner engagement may increase and further support learner agency.
2. If we continue to support the global skill-building process through the assemblies, then learners may
continue to increase their self-confidence and skills in collaboration, critical thinking, and problemsolving.
Overall, CHS leaders strongly believe that by increasing learner engagement on multiple levels and providing
impactful professional learning opportunities, we will continue to experience growth and positive learner
outcomes.
Discussion:
The Engagement of Learning Key Characteristic spans eight critical Performance Standards, so this narrative is
likely to be longer than those of the other Key Characteristics. In this case, the school began with a list of salient
evidence they used to compose the narratives, and while this is not a required element, it often helps both
the institution and the evaluator focus on specific evidence to support the findings. The narrative covers the
Performance Standards as follows:
1. The narrative addresses Standards 16, 18, and 20 through the description of the global skills initiative
and how those skills are manifested through the projects and the assemblies.
2. The narrative addresses Standards 17, 19, and 21 through an analysis of the engagement in the learning
environment and the success of the teachers in increasing overall learner engagement. It also shows
where there is work to be done in addressing individualized learning and learner choice – a key element in
developing learner agency.
144
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
3. The narrative addresses Standards 22 and 23 through a discussion of how teachers are leveraging the
laptops as a digital resource for both learning and monitoring and adjusting instruction.
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that the findings include:
1. Overall engagement has increased; however, additional efforts need to be made to support more choice
and individualization of learning. Additionally, the leaders cited the collateral effects of increasing
engagement, such as discipline and attendance gains.
2. The global skills initiative is successful and should be maintained through continued innovation.
3. The digital tools and resources available have a positive effect on monitoring and adjusting instruction.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect is
developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, leaders noted that the attendance
and discipline data seemed to correlate to the overall engagement in the learning environment. They postulated
that as engagement increases, disciple referrals lower and attendance increases. While this is not necessarily a
universal truth for all institutions, leaders noted that it was applicable at their institution.
For the second finding, leaders noted that the implementation of the global skills initiative was successful because
it engaged learners and facilitated greater ownership of learning. Additionally, because the skills were addressed
in all classes, learners shared a common language and understanding of the skills in multiple contexts. The third
finding, although addressed lightly, was based on teacher feedback. Note that the third finding did not include an
associated theory of action. The two theories of action meet the requirements of the analysis because the first
one shows where growth is needed and the second addresses where the leaders are sustaining a strong practice.
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of both
strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings.
Schools: Growth in Learning
Evidence:
• Analysis of state-level assessment data
• Analysis of school-level summative assessment data
• Analysis of school-level formative assessment data
• 9-week data analysis protocol
• Differentiated lesson plans for small group learning sessions
• Cohort data analysis documentation
• State required career portfolio examples
• Professional learning plan
• Professional learning feedback analysis
• Grade level data analysis documentation
• Analysis of ACT results
Cooper High School believes in leveraging multiple sources of data as we analyze the impact of teaching and
learning on student achievement and academic outcomes. We serve an academically diverse student population
and believe that every student should have an opportunity to succeed. To conduct the analysis on learner
performance, we analyzed summative assessment from the state-level exams, composite scores on ACT, and
the context-bound data from school level end-of-course assessments. Currently, 62% of students are scoring at
or above grade level in all required math assessments, which is an increase from 54% just three years ago when
the math curriculum was adopted. Teachers attribute this growth to both the professional learning focused on
145
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
engaging learners in classroom activities and the support from the intervention system to address learning gaps.
This increase in growth is encouraging; however, more information and data analysis is needed to make sure the
students continue to be successful and meet expectations for learning.
In the subjects of language arts and science, scores on assessments have remained relatively stable, with ELA
scores hovering at 52% mastery and science scores at 48%. These scores have fluctuated up and down by
1% over the past three years. Both leaders and teachers believe that additional interventions, such as those
provided in math, would be beneficial; however, budgetary restraints hinder that option. Both the ELA and science
curriculums have been in place for four years, so leaders and teachers believe that additional professional
development and discussion about how to strengthen learner performance is in order. Student surveys show
that learners are often frustrated that summative tests at the state level and in ACT often do not test what they
have learned in the classes, so the professional staff have determined that a stronger alignment between the
coursework and the assessments would be beneficial. To conduct this alignment, teachers will meet in PLC
groups to analyze the state-level assessment blueprints and ensure that their course maps and curriculum
address the required standards.
As mentioned above, the math department has been provided with additional resources for tutoring; however,
this is part of the overall tiered intervention system for all departments. When learners do not perform well in
class-level assessments, teachers provide collaboration activities and enrichment opportunities for learners who
are successful while the struggling learners are provided with re-teaching sessions. The re-teaching sessions
are embedded in the weekly schedule so that every class can have the opportunity for additional support. This
program has been in place for three years and at the end of each semester, teachers meet to analyze the success
of the program using formative and summative assessment data. Findings from this program analysis include
moderate success in improving learner performance on school-level tests; however, success on state-level
assessments is still elusive. As mentioned above, leaders and teachers believe that strengthening alignment
between the course content and state-level assessments may ameliorate this problem.
We have included our data protocols for analysis of learner achievement in the Accreditation Portfolio. While
this protocol is not highly sophisticated, it does facilitate how teachers understand learner performance in terms
of standards and promotes further understanding of how teachers can target struggling learners for additional
support. Additionally, the protocol also addresses student dispositions towards school and classes from the
student surveys so that teachers are aware of learners’ opinions and attitudes towards school. Teachers are
provided with annual training at the beginning of each school year on how to use the protocol.
Formative assessment data, in the form of weekly content tests and monthly unit tests, is analyzed in the weekly
professional learning teams. During these sessions, teachers identify students who are struggling with content
and determine what available options to pursue. The teacher groups are based on cohorts of learners, not
content, so teachers have opportunities to note patterns in learner performance across content areas. It is not
uncommon for teachers to discover that if learners are struggling in one class, they are often struggling in several
classes. This collaboration has facilitated increased understanding of how teachers can support learners and
work together to unify intervention efforts.
To support non-academic needs of learners, a series of focus groups and support groups were initiated by the
counseling department last year. These support groups include topics such as emotional support, future planning,
academic skills (such as organization and time management), and several other specialized topics. Attendance
in the lunchtime support groups has varied; however, student responses through surveys show that the groups
are helpful and support their interests. Similarly, every student is required to participate in the state-mandated
career planning program. Once per semester, students meet with their counselor and update their online portfolio
that includes information on future career interests and available post-secondary pathways. In their senior year,
students are provided with a printout of their portfolio that lists resources and opportunities that align with their
interest and goals. Cooper High School does not currently have a process to determine the effectiveness of this
program; however, teachers, students, and counselors participate in this requirement with fidelity.
The professional learning program at CHS is embedded in the weekly schedule. Twice per week, teachers have
a 60-minute period to meet in their professional learning teams. The first session is dedicated to addressing
146
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
student performance and interventions, while the second session is dedicated to skill development. The skill
development topics are generated from classroom observation data from the previous semester and have
focused on learner engagement and differentiation. Trend data from the past three years show that learner
engagement has increased by 12% and that differentiation has decreased by 5%. Leaders and teachers have
determined that while engagement strategies are being leveraged successfully, differentiating the activities and
strategies for varying learner needs is considerably more difficult. To address this area, leaders and teacher
leaders prepared a skill development program in the fall of this year that uses current research and techniques
to develop differentiation skills. The program is still in the early stages of delivery, so an analysis of the program’s
effectiveness cannot be fully determined at this time. This spring, leaders and teachers will analyze the classroom
observation data to make determinations on how the program is impacting learner performance and where to
make potential improvements.
Based on the analysis of the Growth in Learning Performance Standards, the leadership team collaboratively
designed the following theories of action:
1. If course curriculum in ELA and science is effectively aligned to state-level summative assessments,
then learners may have a significantly higher opportunity to increase performance levels.
2. If the extra tutoring for struggling math learners is continued, then there may be stronger opportunities
for maintaining positive growth in performance.
3. If professional learning in differentiation is strengthened and supported, then teachers may be able to
more effectively meet learners’ needs.
Growth in learning is embedded in the culture of our institution and reflected by our policies, practices, and
processes.
Discussion:
The Growth in Learning Key Characteristic includes eight Performance Standards. In this case, the school began
with a list of salient evidence they used to compose the narratives. While this is not a required element, it often
helps the institution and the evaluator focus on specific evidence to support the findings. It is important to note
that while this exemplar provides information of each of the Growth in Learning Standards, it does not necessarily
mean that the institution has described meeting the Standards at any particular performance level – in fact, it is
likely the school may be functioning at levels 1 or 2 in some of the Growth in Learning Standards. The narrative
covers the Performance Standards as follows:
1. The narrative addresses Standard 24 through the description of the myriad assessment data, survey
results, and observation data.
2. The narrative addresses Standard 25 and Standard 27 through a description of the iterative and
cyclical approach to the intervention system to support learners through an analysis of performance
data.
3. The narrative addresses Standard 26 through both a description of how the intervention system is
evaluated, but also how some of the programs are not currently evaluated.
4. The narrative addresses Standard 28 through a description of the state-mandated career planning
program.
5. The narrative addresses Standard 29 through a description of basing professional learning on student
survey responses and classroom observation data.
6. The narrative addresses Standard 30 through a description of how summative assessments and
formative assessments measure learning and how those data are leveraged to modify instruction.
7. The narrative addresses Standard 31 through the analysis of student scores and growth rates in the
state-level and site-level assessments.
147
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that the findings include:
1. Math scores are improving.
2. Scores in ELA and science are stagnant.
3. Differentiation in the learning environment is not being successfully implemented.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect is
developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, leaders noted that the math scores
are improving because of the intervention system in place, but also because of the extra funding provided
for tutoring. The second finding was attributed to two main ideas: insufficient interventions and misalignment
between course content and state-level assessments. The third finding was based on the determination that
differentiation is more complex and rigorous than anticipated.
The theories of action address both areas for improvement and areas of strength. Note that the institution
provided two areas for improvement and one area of strength and only one of each is required to meet the highest
score on the rubric.
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of both
strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings.
Systems
Systems: Culture of Learning
Evidence:
• District Vision/Mission statements
• Analyzed stakeholder survey data
• Advisory curriculum
• Advisory program feedback analysis
• Mentor program
• Mentor program data analysis
• PLC structure and protocols
• Sample PLC data analysis (EL, HS)
• HR annual report
The Parnassus School District (PSD) has adopted vision and mission statements that reflect the values and goals
of the schools and the community. The vision of the district is to graduate college and career ready students
who are civic-minded, critical thinkers, and lifelong learners. The mission of the PSD is to provide each and every
student with a world-class education that enables them to be contributing members of society. We endeavor to
create opportunities for all students and work to ensure that each learner is successful, respected, and allowed
to fully develop their potential. Both the vision and mission of the district were collaboratively developed and
approved by all stakeholders, including leaders, teachers, parents, students, and staff. The district annually brings
representatives of all stakeholder groups together formally to review the vision and mission to get feedback on
potential revisions and additions. While the formalized language in the mission and vision have not changed in two
years, there have been opportunities during the recent session (2024) to examine where the system has been
successful and where improvements are needed.
The vision and mission are truly embraced at PSD. Our strategic plan and the associated goals are aligned to the
values in the vision and mission statements. Each site in the district formally engages in a survey and inventory
process twice each year (September and April) to collect stakeholder feedback on the culture and classroom
148
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
experiences. The data from those surveys are collected longitudinally so that progress and areas of concern can
be collaboratively addressed by district leadership and site leadership teams. The recent data analysis from last
spring’s surveys indicates elevated levels of satisfaction with the overall culture of the schools; however, there
was a slight dip in satisfaction regarding academic support and opportunities in the schools. The leadership team
has attributed this change to lower performance levels on summative exams in several of the schools that serve
a predominantly low socio-economic population. Based on that feedback, the strategic plan has been adjusted
to meet the needs of the learners in these schools and appropriate funding has been allocated to bolster the
learning opportunities for these learners. This adjustment includes allocation of funding for tutoring opportunities
and extended time before and after school for teachers to work with learners on specific content and skills.
To support a positive culture in the system, the district has implemented a systemwide advisory program that
meets twice weekly and is supported by a curriculum that includes life skills, peer mentoring, adult mentoring,
and additional flexibility for site-specific needs. Each learner is paired with a caring adult who is responsible for
not only monitoring academic progress but also for making sure non-academic needs are met. The advisory
curriculum includes specific feedback mechanisms to track learner progress and satisfaction with the program
as well as advisor feedback on the curriculum. The district analyzes this feedback monthly to evaluate the
quality of the overall program. Thus far, data indicates that there is varying success of the program. Teachers
feel they need additional time to adjust to the program and curriculum. Learners have responded that they like
the program and activities but feel like it is not making an impactful difference on their academic success. Where
students have responded positively to the program is the opportunity to pair with a teacher who supports their
needs and pays attention to their overall progress in school. Moving forward, leaders will endeavor to align the
activities towards making a more impactful difference on student performance.
The district has recently implemented a systemwide Professional Learning Community (PLC) program so that
teachers and site leaders can communicate with each other about student performance and discuss additional
actions such as reteaching and enrichment opportunities for learners. Professional staff members were provided
with initial training on the process and protocols, and the site leaders are offering mentoring and coaching for
their respective PLC groups so they can continue to develop and increase both the sophistication of their teams
and the impact those teams can have on learner performance. Establishing PLC groups has been a daunting and
complex task; however, leaders have been implementing the process with fidelity by scaffolding concepts such as
data analysis and discussion protocols during the professional learning sessions. Formal feedback mechanisms
have been implemented and those will be analyzed quarterly by the district leadership so they can make
recommendations for continued improvement.
Aligned with the PLC program is the mentoring program for new teachers and staff members. The trend data
from the past three years showed that attrition amongst the new teaching staff was increasing, and an initiative
was needed to support staff members. Exit interviews from departing teachers included information about why
they are leaving and while some were not related to the system, others indicated they felt unsupported or isolated
in the learning environments. The mentoring program includes both new staff members and those who are
experienced but new to the Parnassus district. Experienced staff members are in the program for one year, while
those new to the profession have a three-year commitment. The mentoring program has been in place for a year
and has been effective at retaining new staff members. Retention of new staff members has increased 20% since
the beginning of the program, and as the district makes improvements in the overall organization and content of
the program, leaders hope to see further growth.
To address the areas for improvement identified in the self-analysis process and support the sustainability of the
system’s successful initiatives, the system leadership proposes the following theories of action:
1. If teachers are provided with additional professional learning opportunities to understand and manage
the advisory curriculum and activities, then there may be increased opportunities for successful
implementation of support of students’ academic and non-academic needs.
2. If leaders provide additional training and development of the Professional Learning Community program,
then teachers may have greater opportunities and capacity for understanding how to support positive
learner outcomes.
149
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
3. If the system continues to refine and improve the mentoring program, then new teachers to the system
may continue to stay with the district.
Overall, the culture for learning in PSD is very strong and geared toward learner success; however, we are always
planning to implement improvements as the data and surveys indicate. Parnassus leaders are committed to the
continuous improvement process through collaborative, impactful, and meaningful actions.
Discussion:
The narrative begins with a list of evidence provided to support the observations and Standards related to
Culture of Learning. While this is not a requirement for the narrative, it is added to show that the system is
leveraging multiple sources of data to support their findings. Note how each of the Culture of Learning Standards
were addressed in the narrative:
1. The narrative addresses Standard 1 through their efforts to support a positive environment for each and
every learner.
2. The narrative addresses Standard 2 through the revision and support of the vision and mission of the
system.
3. The narrative addresses Standard 3 through effective collaboration with stakeholders.
4. The narrative addresses Standard 4 through the evidence related to positive relations between
students and staff members.
5. The narrative addresses Standards 5 and 6 through the need to develop additional opportunities
for staff members to develop capacity and collegiality through mentoring and professional learning
community programs.
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that the findings include:
1. The advisory program requires additional resources and support to be more effective.
2. The new PLC process has been implemented with fidelity but requires ongoing support.
3. Staff retention is improving through the mentoring program.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect is
developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, leaders noted that the advisory
program survey data supplied key elements and insight for improvement and success. For the second finding,
leaders noted that the implementation of the PLC program was a complex undertaking that requires ongoing
support and training. Finally, the third finding was developed from exit interview data that indicated that support
was needed to ameliorate feelings of teacher isolation. Note that each of the theories of action is directly related
to these findings.
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of
both strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings. Note that the system
included three theories of action – the requirement for the highest rating is only two; however, they included both
required elements of improvement and support of strength.

Systems: Leadership for Learning
Evidence:
• District strategic plan
• Analyzed stakeholder survey data
• Student performance analysis
• Governing board online records
• Alignment crosswalk—state standards and curriculum
• Curriculum review plan
• Demographic analysis
• ESSA implementation plan
• Curriculum (online)
• Analyzed staff evaluation data
The Parnassus School District (PSD) has engaged in the continuous improvement process for three accreditation
cycles and has endeavored to improve the collaborative improvement process each iteration. The current version
of the PSD Strategic Plan began in the summer of this year with a summative evaluation of the effectiveness
of the previous strategic plan. This process included representation from site leaders, teachers, learners,
parents, community members, and professional staff. After a full analysis of the data, the collective team made
recommendations for the new strategic plan, including specific initiatives for district focus and timelines to
complete each item. The proposed new plan went before the school board and was approved in August of this
year. The governing board also approved multiple budget items to support the plan and noted their appreciation
for aligning the strategic plan with the PSD’s vision and mission statements.
To support the strategic plan, each site was tasked to create their own school improvement plan that is closely
aligned with the district strategic plan. These plans will be collaboratively developed through site-based
stakeholder leadership teams that include parents, administrators, teachers, staff, and learners. The governing
board has allocated funding to support each of these plans and will examine and approve them in September of
this year.
As part of an ongoing effort to improve leadership effectiveness at the district and school level, each department
has designed evaluative criteria and success metrics that are aligned with national leadership standards
in education. Each administrator will provide an individualized action plan that sets performance goals,
improvement goals, and action plans to work collaboratively with other departments in the pursuit of the vision
and mission of the district. An initial needs assessment and survey was conducted to establish baseline data on
current perceptions on leadership roles. This data showed that many of our system and schools leaders feel they
siloed from each other and although relationships amongst leaders are positive, the relative isolation of efforts
and lack of systematic approaches to challenges is preventing greater success. The finding for our system is that
leaders and departments are often in professional silos because of the differences between the sites and the lack
of opportunities to collaborate on a system level.
Every district level and site level employee must be appropriately qualified for their roles, including leaders,
teachers, and professional staff members. The district personnel office maintains extensive records and
documentation to support this priority, including educational transcripts, certifications, fingerprint clearance
records, and employee evaluations. A formal process of review and analysis has been implemented to ensure
that all employee records are current and aligned with their duties. The district has also implemented a data
analysis protocol to annually review records so that employees are informed of when additional renewals and
certifications are pending expiration. Feedback from staff members has been very positive about the notifications
and support from the district.
The district has adopted several nationally recognized curriculums that align to the state standards for both
elementary and secondary classes. These curricula are reviewed cyclically on a rotating basis every year. The
151
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
process is formalized and includes participation of administrators, teachers, and support staff, with additional
survey input from parents and learners. Each year, three curricular areas are reviewed, and recommendations
are submitted to the executive director of Curriculum and Instruction for approval. Upon approval, the executive
director reports to the superintendent for the recommendations to be taken to the governing board for approval.
The current cycle for this year includes science, physical education, and social studies. The process involves data
regarding learner performance on benchmark and summative assessments, classroom observation data, and
survey information from teachers and learners. The governing board allocates appropriate funding every fiscal
year to support the process and the acquisition of materials if indicated.
Because of the high level of diversity in the district, including racial, student performance, and socioeconomic
factors, the district leadership has been keenly focused on improving educational quality for each and every
learner and each of the sites. Utilizing performance data analyses, the district has allocated additional funds
(approved by the governing board) to support additional tutoring, reteaching, and enrichment activities to close
performance gaps, mainly between learners who qualify for Title I services and those who do not. The district has
identified two high schools and eight elementary schools to receive additional funding based on these learner
needs. System leaders have determined that additional resources are needed to support Title I schools to meet
learner’s needs.
Based on the analysis of Leadership for Learning Standards, survey data, student performance scores, and the
strategic plan, the system has determined that to support the findings from above, several theories of action will
be pursued:
1. If system leaders add and support a collaborative element to the overall leadership development plans
which include opportunities for sites to work together, then we may be able to reduce the isolation of our
work and integrate our district functions more effectively.
2. If the system supports the struggling learners at the Title I schools through additional funding for
interventions, then learners may have additional opportunities to increase their performance.
3. If system leaders continue to support and act on recommendations from the cyclical curriculum review
process, then learners and teachers may have greater opportunities to experience relevant learning
experiences that are aligned to state standards.
Overall, the Leadership for Learning environment at PSD is focused on building capacity, leveraging data to
improve district performance, and developing all stakeholders to be active participants in the educational
environment. The district is proud to engage in the continuous improvement cycle and looks forward to feedback
from the process.
Discussion:
The above narrative would be considered exemplary because it addresses the rubric, the writing prompts, and
the Cognia Performance Standards. Note how the narrative addresses the Leadership for Learning Standards:
1. Standard 7 is addressed through the continuous improvement process and includes information on the
review and alignment of the plan with the system’s sites.
2. Standard 8 is addressed through the support of resources by the governing authority and the alignment
of the continuous improvement plan.
3. Standard 9 is addressed through a description of how the system works to eliminate silos and design
goals for each leader.
4. Standard 10 and Standard 13 are addressed through an analysis of HR records, improvement goals for
leaders, and communication with teachers on required certification updates. It includes data to support
the findings and actions of leadership.
5. Standard 11 is addressed in the description of procedures and processes to sustain strong
organizational practices in the improvement plan process and meet the needs of sites and learners.
6. Standard 12 is addressed by the description of the curriculum review and the ongoing need for cyclical
review and updates.
152
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
7. Standard 14 is addressed through a description of both the curriculum review cycle to ensure relevancy
and alignment to state-level standards.
8. Standard 15 is addressed by the analysis of student performance and the need to further support Title I
sites and learners.
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that the findings include:
1. Title I sites and learners need additional support to close performance gaps.
2. Leaders and teachers are in professional silos that prevent positive outcomes.
3. The curriculum review process is functioning well and needs to continue.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect
is developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, they noted that professional
silos occur because of the lack of opportunities to collaborate across the system. For the second finding, the
narrative highlighted the performance data and the existing gaps between Title I learners and non-Title I learners.
Additionally, the narrative includes information on a process that is successful, namely through the alignment with
state-level learning standards. Note also that while there were other findings in narrative, the leaders focused on
three findings to highlight, which meets the requirements of the Cognia rubric.
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of both
strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings. The writing prompts ask
the institution to explain how leaders communicate expectations and monitor progress, how leadership models
desired behaviors, and how leadership is distributed. By focusing on elements of leadership like collaboration and
learner needs based on performance, the school has effectively addressed these prompts.
Systems: Engagement of Learning
Evidence:
• Continuous improvement plan (system)
• Continuous improvement plan (sites)
• District curriculum
• Action team operations guide (minutes, recommendations)
• Analyzed stakeholder surveys
• Professional development plan
• Analyzed learner performance
• Curriculum review cycle plan
• RTI program guide
• Digital learning initiative plan
The Parnassus Unified School District believes that all learners can be successful, and that supporting each
and every learner is the keystone to success. As part of the system’s continuous improvement plan, a team of
site-based and district leaders, teachers, and parents formed an action group two years ago to address student
academic and non-academic issues in the schools and make recommendations on programming, curriculum, and
other aspects to support learner success. This group includes stakeholders from all categories and meets semimonthly
to discuss their work. The summaries of their actions thus far are included in the Accreditation Portfolio.
Curriculum in the system is based off the state standards; however, district leaders noted that state standards
do not always include opportunities for 21st century skill development and have encouraged all sites to include
additional support curriculum materials and subjects through an approval process set up by the system’s action
153
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
group mentioned above. Stakeholder surveys regarding these materials indicate a wide range of agreement and
support, so the action group carefully examines any enrichment and supplemental materials and subjects offered
to learners for criteria such as age-appropriateness and validity of information. The system leadership believes
that a rich curriculum that expands learners’ awareness of global skills is an important element to developing
critical thinkers and well-rounded young adults, so this process is critical in support of the system’s mission.
The system administers multiple surveys to all stakeholders and analyzes the results to guide improvement
actions and new initiatives. Access to honors classes and competency-based learning programs were frequently
requested items in the recent fall stakeholder survey. Many elementary learners have shown potential to move
quickly through grade-level standards, so the system has provided enrichment and other opportunities to allow
elementary learners to move at a pace commensurate with their skills and mastery levels. Additionally, learners
who are struggling with mastery are provided interventions such as reteaching and tutoring opportunities as
needed. The system has allocated additional funding for underperforming learners to receive additional services.
Thus far, feedback on the enrichment activities and competency-based process has produced mixed results,
as the system and site leaders were not fully prepared for the effects of rapidly successful learners. Some of
the challenges included grade-level assignments and capacity to meet the staffing and teaching needs for all
students. Feedback from the extra tutoring opportunities and re-teaching programs have resulted in increased
performance; however, in its current form, the program is not fiscally sustainable. The system leadership is
working on how to support the program through grants and other budgetary adjustments.
Professional development for instructional staff has emphasized two key areas in the past year: learner
investment in their education and differentiation in instruction. As part of the professional development plan,
teachers have been creating lessons that incorporate differentiation strategies based off researched methods
to not only address different learner abilities, but also to provide learner choice, primarily in how the learner
demonstrates mastery of content. While exceptionally difficult, teachers have responded positively to recent
surveys on the impact professional development has had on their awareness of the need for differentiation and
on the impact that choice has had on learner attitudes toward learning.
Each site has multiple teams of instructors and leaders who work collaboratively to review curriculum for
rigor and relevance on an annual basis. These teams address grade-level standards and subject matter
depending on the grade level and the curriculum that is due for that year’s cycle. For each team, assessment
and learning materials are reviewed for rigor and appropriateness. The team makes recommendations for
changes or modifications based on current assessment scores, teacher input, and student success levels. All
recommendations are reviewed by the system leadership and then brought to the board for final approval and
adoption.
Based on the analyzed learner performance data and teacher input through surveys and committee work, the
response to intervention (RTI) programs are undergoing systemic review for effectiveness. Recent teacher
feedback from many of the sites has indicated that the RTI program is not meeting the needs of learners because
of the complicated process involved for tier 2 and tier 3 interventions, including paperwork, identification issues,
and follow-up procedures. This review will be the focus of system leadership study groups in the upcoming
school year. Leaders plan on meeting weekly to analyze and revise the RTI program for greater efficiency and
effectiveness and make recommendations to the superintendent by the spring semester. By analyzing the
problems associated with the program, the system is engaging in an action research process with intentionality
and fidelity. Results from the overall analysis will be shared with all sites and stakeholders when the work is
complete.
To emphasize skills required for modern learners, the system has recommended that digital learning
opportunities be integrated into lessons and course maps. While only 23% of courses currently have a digital
learning component, site leaders and teachers are collaborating to ensure meaningful digital learning experiences
are integrated into lessons. During a recent focus group, teachers strongly advocated to make sure the digital
integration was not contrived or tacked on as a compliance issue but only added as a meaningful part of the
lessons. Future professional development may be necessary to meet this need to ensure learners are being
taught 21st century skills.
154
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Based on the findings of the system’s analysis of engagement of learning, the system leadership has developed
several theories of action to make improvements in supporting learner agency and engagement and support
programs that are performing well:
1. If the system continues to support the process of enriching coursework with content and materials that
encourage 21st century skills, then learners will have a better opportunity to develop critical thinking,
collaborative problem-solving, and real-world global skills.
2. If the professional development program effectively addresses the differentiated needs of learners and
provides the skills to incorporate learner choice and agency, then all learners will grow in confidence and
embrace lifelong learning.
3. If leaders develop systems and capacity to meet the needs of rapidly successful learners, then
competency-based programs will have greater impact and support.
4. If the system provides the opportunity for all educators to integrate digital learning into their lessons in a
meaningful manner, the learners will develop important skills that will not only improve their educational
experience but instill a sense of ownership and ability to successfully pursue their interests.
Discussion:
The Engagement of Learning Key Characteristic spans eight critical Performance Standards, so this narrative
is likely to be longer than those of the other Key Characteristics. In this case, the system began with a list of
salient evidence they used to compose the narratives, and while this is not a required element, it often helps both
the institution and the evaluator focus on specific evidence to support the findings. The narrative covers the
Performance Standards as follows:
1. The narrative addresses Standard 16 and Standard 18 through the opportunity to augment the
curriculum and lessons through additional materials and content, especially through items that support a
global perspective and 21st century skills.
2. The narrative addresses Standard 17 through the system’s work to establish an action team to increase
learner support and opportunities. While the scope of the action team is wide, the capacity to support
learners through additional opportunities has been established.
3. The narrative addresses Standard 19 and Standard 21 through a review of the process to permit
learners choice in demonstrating mastery, moving forward with learning when students can demonstrate
mastery, and focuses on learners reaching their potential. While the endeavors are not entirely
successful, it does address the elements of the Standards.
4. The narrative addresses Standard 22 through a description of the RTI process and the needs to
support learning understanding of the curriculum. While this approach is from the perspective of
remediation (there are other potential perspectives), it does indicate progress towards meeting the
intent of the Standard.
5. The narrative addresses Standard 23 through the description of how digital learning is being integrated
into lessons.
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the institution clearly states that the findings include:
1. The addition of additional materials and information to support the existing curriculum is required to
meet the needs of global skills and understanding.
2. Supporting the varying needs of learner performance has been challenging for the system and more
work needs to be done to support available programs.
3. Further professional learning is needed to include digital resources in a meaningful and impactful way.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect
is developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, leaders noted that additional
supplemental materials are often necessary because the state standards do not always address 21st century
155
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
skills. Leaders understand that a transparent and collaborative process is required for additional materials and
information.
For the second finding, leaders noted that the implementation of the competency-based program had some
unintended consequences and the extra support for learners needing interventions was not financially
sustainable. They noted with frankness that they did not foresee the challenges involved and knew that additional
work is needed.
The third finding is implied, but the system realizes that adding elements into instruction as part of a compliance
measure or “doing something for the sake of doing something” is often not successful or meaningful. Their root
cause for integration of digital learning into lessons with fidelity is based on the need for learners to have these
skills to be successful.
Note that this system ambitiously chose four theories of action. Only two are required but note that two of them
focus on continuing success and two of them focus on needed improvements. When the evaluator scores
this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough and aligned content, the
inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of both strengths and areas for
improvement, and theories of action to support those findings.
Systems: Growth in Learning
Evidence:
• Continuous improvement plan (system)
• Continuous improvement plan (sites)
• Learner performance analysis
• Professional development plan
• Classroom observation analysis
• Attendance data
• Analyzed stakeholder feedback analysis
• PLC plan
• Core skills integration plan
• Independent project portfolio collection
The Parnassus Unified School District (PSD) has been consistent in collecting, analyzing, and using multiple
sources of data to inform continuous improvement efforts across the system. The district uploaded the
comprehensive continuous improvement plan derived from input from multiple stakeholder groups and inclusive
of data from student formative and summative assessments, classroom observation data, attendance data,
and other sources of longitudinal data. Taking into account the historical context of PSD, recent challenges
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and future growth plans for the district resulting from demographic
changes at the school and the surrounding community, the five-year continuous improvement plan provides
documentation of analyzed data that supports the initiatives of increasing student performance on state
assessments, increasing student engagement by providing intentional professional development on engagement
strategies, increasing attendance of staff and learners, and aligning site-based continuous improvement plans
with the district continuous improvement plan. School leadership provided documentation from site-based PLCs
as well as district PLCs that supports regular and intentional data-dives from multiple stakeholder groups and
multiple sources of data including, but not limited to: student performance data from the state-level summative
assessments in math, science, and language arts, the National Assessment of Academic Progress (NAEP),
student formative data from site-based assessments, student participation in tutoring and extracurricular
activities, classroom observation data collected using the Effective Leaning Environments Observation Tool
(eleot), documented attendance in school and after school activities, and survey data.
156
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Student performance in state-level assessments has increased in math by 13% over three years to 54% achieving
mastery while scores in language arts and science have remained constant at 39% and 32% respectively. An
analysis of student performance indicates that students and schools in the system that qualify for Title I funding
are performing lower than non-Title I learners and schools. To address these gaps in performance, two programs
have been initiated to support these learners, including funding for after school tutoring (including services and
transportation) and standards-focused in-school learning sessions where students meet during the school day
and receive specialized instruction focused on specific learning targets. To support all learners in improving
achievement, teachers have developed formative assessments aligned to state-level assessments to gauge
learner progress on specific standards. This immediate and focused feedback will be instrumental in identifying
specific learner needs. As this program is only one semester into implementation, data on the effectiveness of
these formative measures is not currently available; however, teachers have noted that the results have provided
key insight into which lessons require additional focus and reteaching.
To guide the professional learning program at each of the sites, teachers and staff participate in schoolwide and
districtwide Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) to analyze data and participate in action research designed to
diagnose issues and find solutions utilizing multiple sources of data aimed at improving professional practice
to increase student learning and success. Through this process of inquiry, the district developed overall goals
for professional learning and the sites aligned their contextual needs to the overall system plan. The district
provided calendars documenting plans for long-range planning of PLC meetings, governing board meetings, and
site council meetings, and district-level leadership provided action steps for interventions aimed at continuous
improvement plan initiatives. Comprehensive staff evaluation documents, PLC data analysis documents, and
survey data were used to not only inform and evaluate the continuous improvement plan, but also to evaluate
instructional programs and organizational conditions aimed at increasing learner performance and staff
retention.
The professional development program has planned and implemented several learning opportunities for staff
members regarding differentiation in the classroom and facilitating student choices in projects and learning goals.
Learners are encouraged to explore the curriculum in the classes and make choices on how they demonstrate
mastery through a set of options made available to them. Additionally, learners may also opt to choose their
own projects based on teacher approval and alignment with the course goals. While most of the learners choose
from the prepared options, some learners, around 4%, work with their teachers to use their own unique projects.
Additionally, learners in the high school levels participate in the state-mandated career exploration online
surveys. Learners are required to complete the interest-based surveys every year and are provided with their
results through advisory programs. Results include available career options, school options, and potential career
pathways. Data regarding these pathways has been collected and analyzed so the system can track where
additional supplemental courses could be offered.
Because PSD believes in educating the whole learner, the district has long adopted several core skills to be
integrated into all courses and classes. Established by the leadership team during the last review cycle, the core
skills include perseverance, accountability, critical thinking, and collaboration. To gauge these skills, benchmarks
are established at all grade levels and assessed regularly through the advisory program and normal lessons.
Data points regarding these skills are collected and maintained for each learner as they matriculate through the
system, and each advisory teacher assists the learners to establish several goals each year. Longitudinal results
collected and analyzed by system leaders show that critical thinking and collaboration skills have increased
steadily, while perseverance and accountability skills have stayed constant. System leaders have determined
that since perseverance and accountability is measured through qualitative means, it is difficult to track growth
objectively. Leaders are currently collaborating on how to collect quantitative data on these skills so progress can
be tracked numerically and changes to how the system approaches these important skills can be determined.
157
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Overall, the PSD believes that continued growth in learner performance and skills is an essential function of the
system. To this end, the system has designed the following theories of action based on the status of the selfevaluation
of the Cognia Performance Standards.
1. If the system leaders collect and analyze formative and summative data at the system level so that
learner progress across all demographic areas can be monitored, then the system can target additional
resources for those learners who are struggling.
2. If professional learning is continually focused on the contextual needs of the sites, then there may be
greater opportunities for each site to meet instructional and performance goals.
3. If data from the core skills can be collected and analyzed, then additional support for those areas that
require improvement can be implemented with fidelity and purposefulness.
The PSD believes that if our system engages with the theories of action with fidelity, then learner performance
and growth will continuously improve.
Discussion:
The Growth in Learning Key Characteristic includes eight Performance Standards. In this case, the system began
with a list of salient evidence they used to compose the narratives. While this is not a required element, it often
helps the institution and the evaluator focus on specific evidence to support the findings. It is important to note
that while this exemplar provides information of each of the Growth in Learning Standards, it does not necessarily
mean that the system has described meeting the Standards at any particular performance level – in fact, it is
likely the system may be functioning at levels 1 or 2 in some of the Growth in Learning Standards. The narrative
covers the Performance Standards as follows:
1. The narrative addresses Standard 24 through the description of the myriad assessment data, survey
results, and observation data used to guide improvement.
2. The narrative addresses Standard 25 through a description of the iterative and cyclical approach to
professional practices to support learners through an analysis of performance data.
3. The narrative addresses Standard 26 through both a description of how the continuous improvement
plan is evaluated, but also how some of the other programs are evaluated.
4. The narrative addresses Standard 27 through the description of the intervention programs and a
description of the tutoring offerings.
5. The narrative addresses Standard 28 through a description of the state-mandated career planning
program.
6. The narrative addresses Standard 29 through a description of basing professional learning on sitebased
needs and associating those needs to performance on assessments.
7. The narrative addresses Standard 30 through a description of how summative assessments and
formative assessments measure learning and how those data are leveraged to modify interventions.
8. The narrative addresses Standard 31 through the analysis of student scores and growth rates in statelevel
and site-level assessments.
One of the key elements in all of the Key Characteristics narratives is the development of findings based on the
analysis of the evidence and data. In the above narrative, the system clearly states that the findings include:
1. There are gaps in learner performance.
2. There are varying needs for professional learning from site to site.
3. Life-long skill development is increasing in some areas, but not accurately measurable in others.
Each of these findings is supported through the evidence provided. Additionally, another important aspect is
developing a root cause for each of the findings. In the case of this narrative, leaders noted that the gaps in learner
performance may be attributable to the challenges that Title I learners face. The second finding was attributed
158
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
to the varying needs and contexts of the sites. The third finding was based on the determination that measuring
perseverance and accountability needed clearer metrics.
The theories of action address both areas for improvement and areas of strength. Note that the institution
provided two areas for improvement and one area of strength and only one of each is required to meet the highest
score on the rubric.
When the evaluator scores this narrative, they would rate each of the categories a “4” because of the thorough
and aligned content, the inclusion of information responding to the provided writing prompts, the inclusion of both
strengths and areas for improvement, and theories of action to support those findings.

increase in our performance in several areas. Four-year cohort graduation data at Cooper High School (CHS) has
increased from an average of 82% in 2022 to 91% in 2024. The leadership team identified several factors for this
growth, including the removal of state-level assessments as a graduation requirement and interventions designed
to track learner progress towards graduation requirements. Many of the learners who are not graduating in the
four-year cohort have been identified as eligible for Title I services, so the leadership team is collaborating with
counselors to determine additional interventions to support these learners.
Overall Language Arts performance on state-level summative assessments shows a generally positive trend in
grades 9 and 11. Despite occasional dips in performance, our year-to-year comparison data show increases in
performance from 64% proficiency in 2021 to 70% proficiency in 2024. However, the cohort achievement data
show some declines such as the ninth graders in 2021 achieved 64% proficiency in language arts but 56% as
11th graders in 2023. Disaggregation of the data by demographics shows that the achievement gap between
demographic groups such as special needs learners and regular education learners has increased by 15%, an
indication that targeted reteaching and tutoring support has not been as effective as intended.
SAT performance has remained steady over the last five years. We have moved into the top 10% of schools in our
state in SAT performance over this period. Our low SES subgroup has made gains on all summative assessments
since 2021; the discrepancy in performance between low SES students and “all” students has narrowed by 5%
over that time span. These results are consistent with elements of our survey data, which have shown increased
satisfaction from stakeholders (staff, students, parents) with the quality of our system’s programs for college- and
career-readiness. Overall, our learners who qualify for Title I services are still scoring lower compared to the non-
Title I learners; however, the school is continuing to provide targeted tutoring and study sessions to close this gap.
Our students with learning disabilities have shown persistent low performance on all assessments and in the
graduation rates over the last several years, with gaps increasing over time. Our state department of public
instruction has identified us as “underperforming” in this category owing to this trend. This gap has not always
been evident to stakeholders because our overall performance has increased slightly during the same period.
Another area of concern is performance in mathematics, which has not shown growth over the last several
years. While we are in the top third of schools in our region in English Language Arts, we are in the lower half for
mathematics. Based on observation data and student survey data, this decline in performance is attributable to
low levels of engagement in math classes and a lack of connection between the math standards and real-world
application to the content.
A review of our data has resulted in several findings. Despite some success, our school has been stagnant in
several critical areas. Our priority is that we see a need for deeper analysis and ownership of achievement data
160
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
on the part of all stakeholders to prevent what looks like “acceptable” performance to mask achievement gaps.
If our new strategic plan (currently under development) includes systematic training on fully disaggregating data
with an eye toward identifying gaps, particularly among demographic and Title I categories, we will most likely
see improvements in this area. Our second priority is that we believe our Public Information office at the system
level can increase transparency in its communication on student achievement, resulting in higher stakeholder
satisfaction. We will also focus on aligning our needs in math, ELA, science, and special education with our
recruitment/retention strategies and professional development efforts, including a differentiated salary schedule
and other incentives to recruit staff to serve in areas of identified need. Additional funding for professional
development in ELA, science, and special education to improve performance from veteran teachers could have a
positive impact on student performance.
Improving administrators’ instructional supervision skills will allow them to better observe and address
weaknesses in pedagogy. Our overall theory of action is that if we can analyze and use data more effectively
to identify learners in need and train our instructors effectively on proven engagement strategies, then we can
increase our graduation rates, close achievement gaps, and increase overall student outcomes.
To summarize, our theories of action include:
1. If we focus professional learning on student engagement (particularly in math), then we may see growth
in learner performance in all learner subgroups.
2. If we continue to provide individualized learner interventions for all learners in assessment and
graduation progress, then we may see rising graduation rates and improved performance.
Discussion:
The required analysis for student performance will be a crucial step in the self-assessment process. In this
example, the institution has identified the assessments used to make determinations, including the state-level
assessments and the global-level assessment of SAT. Additionally, the institution addresses overall school
performance through the analysis of graduation rates over time.
One of the key elements in this required analysis is to make determinations of why scores are increasing,
decreasing, or remaining static. The narrative provides some information on specific interventions and notes that
overall scores do not always tell the entire story: disaggregated data showed that there were gaps in performance
amongst subgroups. Additionally, the school indicated that observation data showed that engagement was
relatively low in math classes and that students didn’t understand how what they were learning was relevant.
The school noted that increasing engagement was a first step to addressing this issue, and while they could
have added an element of increasing relevancy, they focused instead on a scaffolded approach that started with
engagement.
The school has met the key requirements for this analysis by providing information on what is going well and what
requires improvement. Additionally, the leaders provided information on what they believed were root-causes of
these trends. By engaging in this process with fidelity, the school now has an excellent understanding on many
elements of learner performance and will have some solid evidence to support many of the Cognia Performance
Standards, including Standards 30 and 31, which deal directly will student performance.
Schools: Stakeholder Feedback Analysis
Evidence:
• School strategic plan
• Site council representation
• Continuous improvement plan
• Survey analysis report
• Survey plan
• Professional development plan
161
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
• Classroom observation analysis
• Theories of action statements
Cooper High School (CHS) considers stakeholder feedback an essential element of the continuous improvement
process. To this end, CHS includes representation from all stakeholder groups in the site council. The strategic
planning committee meets twice annually to review the strategic plan and feedback data to inform their decisionmaking
on modifications and updates on the strategic plan. The site council meets monthly to discuss site-based
issues, track the continuous improvement plan, and analyze feedback data when it is available.
CHS utilizes the Cognia eProve Surveys platform to conduct stakeholder surveys twice annually. CHS
administers the Culture Survey (CS), the Middle/High School Student Survey (MHSS), the Family Survey
(FS), and the Educator Survey (ES) twice annually, once in September and once in April to gauge stakeholder
feedback. This survey data is collected longitudinally so that ongoing progress on community perceptions can
be analyzed and acted upon. Because the CHS uses an additional systemwide survey to gauge the perceptions
of stakeholders using the eProve platform (but not a certified content survey), we have rated our evaluative
criteria as a 3 in Item Quality. The other ratings were Administration: 3, Number of Responses: 3, and Equity of
Respondents: 2. Administration was rated at a 3 because families did not meet the threshold for responses that
were anticipated; however, the other stakeholder groups responded in high numbers. While all target populations
were represented, the response rate was between 50% and 75%, which met the criteria for a rating of 3 in the
Number of Responses category. The Equity rating was rated as 2 because there were gaps in the response rate
between some subgroups.
The current September responses to the surveys show that 80% of the high school learners, 96% of the
professional staff, and 23% of the families responded to the survey. High learner responses are attributed to the
Advisory Program, which allocates time in the program to respond to these surveys. Additionally, staff members
utilize professional development time twice a year to answer the surveys. Families and parents are emailed the
surveys and are also provided additional time twice annually at board meetings and time during several sitebased
events to respond to the surveys. While learner and staff responses are high, the CHS leadership believes
they could improve the response rate for families and parents by including the survey links in newsletters and
publishing the links on the CHS website.
Recent results from the learners show that at all levels, a welcoming environment, respect, and caring are the
most common selections regarding the learning environment. CHS learners frequently responded that teachers
did not ask what the learners thought about the lessons but did indicate that the use of digital resources were
common in daily activities. CHS is considering a professional development session dedicated to gathering learner
feedback to see if the lessons were meeting their learning needs.
Families and parents enthusiastically responded that the school was safe, welcoming, and respectful; however,
there was a decrease in the response of “warm environment.” This decrease is being analyzed utilizing the
root-cause fishbone method. Learner responses to classroom activities were promising, as recent professional
development has focused on high levels of classroom engagement. Learners responded that classes were
engaging and that working collaboratively with others was a frequent response. On the other hand, many
learners indicated that worksheets were common activities, and solving problems scored lower than in previous
years. CHS has attributed these responses to state-level changes in required curriculum and that lesson-plan
development has been started over for several ELA courses. The school leadership team is in the process
of comparing classroom observation data to see if there is a correlation between the survey results and the
observed classroom environment.
The school leaders, in collaboration with stakeholders, have devised theories of action to address stakeholder
concerns that surfaced during the analysis of the feedback data.
1. If the site leaders develop additional opportunities for families to respond to surveys, then there may be
greater opportunities for increased feedback and stakeholders may have an increased voice in school
issues.
162
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
2. If the professional development program continues to target learner engagement, then classrooms may
become more interactive, and learners may engage with the curriculum more successfully.
3. If CHS leaders focus on training classified employees in protocols and procedures to welcome guests
and families, then stakeholders may see the school as a warm and inviting place.
Cooper High School strongly believes that stakeholder feedback is a critical element to the district’s success and
endeavors to engage all stakeholders in the learning environment.
Discussion:
Stakeholder feedback is often a challenging area for schools as the data collected is often qualitative data that
depends a great deal on interpretation and analysis. In this example, school leaders collected the data with fidelity
and noted that the consistency of the survey helped them to identify trends. This is likely the most challenging
part for schools – as surveys change over time, as do school leaders and processes.
In this example, the school noted the evidence they used to reach their findings and included information on their
interpretation of the root causes of the findings. The findings included:
1. Not all families were responding to surveys consistently.
2. Classes were engaging learners successfully (although there was additional room for growth).
3. Parents indicated that they did not feel the school was as welcoming as it could be.
Leaders then took this information and worked to determine “why” these findings were occurring and converted
those ideas into theories of action. The requirement for this required analysis is at least one theory of action for
improvement and one theory of action to support a successful practice. In this case, the school provided two
theories of action for improvement and one theory of action to sustain a solid practice. Note that the evidence,
the findings, and the analysis were aligned throughout the narrative. This example would be rated highly by an
evaluator because of the clarity, alignment, and the associated theories of action.
Schools: Learning Environment Observation Analysis
Evidence:
• eleot observation summary
• Classroom observation plan
• Analyzed eleot ratings
• Analyzed eleot ratings by subgroups
• Professional learning plan
• Theory of action statements
Cooper High School (CHS) has utilized the Cognia eleot for classroom observations since 2020. During that time,
all administrators and teacher leaders were required to train in the protocol using the available seats provided
by Cognia. Each department has two trained members, and all school leaders are trained. CHS has prepared an
observation plan and schedule to meet the requirements of every learning environment being observed during
the school year at least three times. Additionally, twelve of the system leadership team members were trained in
the protocol and provided additional support for CHS to reach the observation goals.
Because CHS utilizes eleot, the first category of the evaluative criteria was not required to be rated. The
remaining ECs were rated as 4 because the system ensures that all observers are fully certified in eleot and that
all observations meet the full criteria of the observation requirements. Observation data is collected and analyzed
on two main levels: schoolwide observation data and departmentwide observation data. Additionally, the
department observations are further disaggregated by course. CHS utilized professional learning time quarterly
to analyze observation data and make recommendations to the professional learning team. While there are seven
163
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
major categories in the observation tool, and all of them are evaluated during the classroom observations, the
school has focused on the engagement and high expectations categories for this analysis.
Results from the school level show that learner engagement is increasing at all levels. This is likely a direct result
of focused professional development for teachers to engage all learners in specific engagement strategies.
Additional professional learning will focus on the strategies that were successful so other teachers can
successfully engage learners in all subjects. However, engagement varied significantly by department. Content
involving CTE, arts, physical education, and science were high in engagement, while ELA and math classes were
much lower. Math classes ranked the lowest on engagement, although the scores were higher than those from the
previous year.
The high expectations ratings were higher than those of the previous year; however, last year’s ratings were highly
affected by the need to teach remotely due to severe weather conditions. When disaggregated, the ratings for
learners being able to express and describe high quality work were rated as a 3.4, which was an increase from the
previous year of 3.1. The analysis team believes that this higher rating was the result of very specific instructions
and materials produced to facilitate online learning, a skill that has now been successfully transferred back into
the live classroom. The highest increase in the category was learners being self-directed, which was rated at 3.3,
a significant increase from last year’s score of 2.4. Again, this information was believed to be a skill augmented
by remote instruction, as learners were required to independently engage with course materials more frequently
than in previous years. Survey analysis confirmed this interpretation by the leadership team.
An integral part of the instructional model for CHS includes the use of data to inform instructional decisions such
as when to reteach or approach content in a different manner. To support this process, professional development
will be implemented in the upcoming year that focuses on improving instructional staff’s use of formative
assessment, including the process of checking for understanding several times during a lesson. Supplementing
these skills will be additional coaching on implementing the checks for understanding using active classroom
techniques. As part of the school’s continuous improvement plan, growth in the progress monitoring and active
learning environment are targeted for specific improvement in the coming school year. The theories of action that
CHS is adopting are as follows:
1. If we provide professional learning in the progress monitoring of learners, then overall eleot scores may
rise in this category as might overall student performance.
2. If we continue to offer feedback from the observations, then teachers may create even more engaging
and active learning environments so that learner performance may increase.
All CHS leaders are committed to leveraging the eleot to improve learner performance and believe that continued
professional learning will improve the capacity of all instructional staff to increase learner engagement and
success.
Discussion:
Analyzing learner environments is a key element in the self-assessment process. Learner engagement
and success is at the heart of most schools, and it includes a broad spectrum of potential topics, including
engagement, rigor, teacher effectiveness, and even culture of the institution. Given that, the analysis above does
not try to cover everything germane to learning environments but does focus on specific elements. The above
school leverages the Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool (eleot) to provide feedback on learner
engagement, specifically in high expectations and overall learner engagement. The school leaders provided a
brief overview of the process and the results from recent analysis sessions.
Additionally, note that while the observation data might be considered a single item of evidence, the way the
school disaggregated the data creates multiple data points in addition to the inclusion of the professional learning
plan. Both the findings and the root causes of those findings were discussed in the narrative and drove the
creation of the theories of action. Also note that the school addresses what is going well and where improvements
are needed to increase overall performance on the observation tool and potentially learner performance.

• Analyzed survey data included exit interview data
• State report on system and schools
• Data analysis plan
• Communication plan
• Professional learning plan
The learner performance leadership team has disaggregated data by subgroups and have noted a steady
increase in our performance in several areas. Four-year cohort graduation data in three of the four schools has
increased from an average of 82% in 2021 to 91% in 2024. One of the schools has not met the same success
and continues to graduate students at 84% in the four-year cohort. The leadership team is working to identify
additional factors for this lack of growth and plans to address the issue immediately. Many of the learners who are
not graduating in the four-year cohort have been identified as eligible for Title I services.
Overall Language Arts performance on state-level assessments show a generally positive trend in grades 4, 8,
and 11. Despite occasional dips in performance, our year-to-year comparison data show increases in performance
from 64% proficiency in 2021 to 70% proficiency in 2024. Additionally, the cohort achievement data show some
successes such as the third graders in 2021 achieved 56% proficiency in Language Arts but 64% as fifth graders
in 2023. Disaggregation of the data by demographics shows that the achievement gap between groups has
decreased by 15%, an indication that targeted reteaching and tutoring support has been effective.
SAT performance has remained steady over the last five years. We have moved into the top 10% of school
districts in our state in SAT performance over this period. Our low SES subgroup has made gains on all summative
assessments since 2021; the discrepancy in performance between low SES students and “all” students has
narrowed by 5% over that time span. These results are consistent with some of our survey data, which have
shown increased satisfaction from stakeholders (staff, students, parents) with the quality of our system’s
programs for college and career readiness. Overall, our learners categorized as Title I are still scoring lower
compared to the non-Title I learners; however, the system is continuing to provide targeted tutoring and study
sessions to close this gap.
Our students with learning disabilities have shown persistent low performance on all assessments and in the
graduation rates over the last several years, with gaps increasing over time. Our state department of public
instruction has identified this element as “underperforming” owing to this trend. This gap has not always been
evident to stakeholders because our overall performance has increased slightly during the same period. Another
area of concern is performance in mathematics, which has not shown growth over the last several years. While
we are in the top third of districts in our region in English Language Arts, we are in the lower half for mathematics.
We have noted the considerable gaps in performance among the schools within our district. For example, the
Hyperion schools have performed well above the district average in mathematics. This may be attributable to
the strong vertical alignment in mathematics in that area. Teachers and administrators have a well-established
professional learning community among those schools that are not in place in the other three zones. The other
three zones are below the state average in math scores. These achievement trends may be related to the
165
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
high staff turnover in middle- and high-school mathematics and special education in these areas; our Human
Resources Department has presented recruitment/retention data in these areas to our strategic planning team.
Review of our data has resulted in several findings. Despite some success, our district has been stagnant in
several critical performance areas such as state assessments and graduation rates. Our first priority is that we
see a need for deeper analysis and ownership of achievement data on the part of all stakeholders to prevent
what looks like “acceptable” performance to mask achievement gaps. If our new strategic plan (currently under
development) includes systematic training on fully disaggregating data with an eye toward identifying gaps,
particularly among racial and Title I categories, we will be able to identify opportunities for improvements in these
areas with greater accuracy. Our second priority is that we believe our Public Information office can increase
transparency in its communication on student achievement, resulting in higher stakeholder understanding and
potentially satisfaction. We will also focus on aligning our needs in mathematics and special education with our
recruitment/retention strategies and professional development efforts, including a differentiated salary schedule
and other incentives to recruit staff to serve in areas of identified need. Additional funding for professional
development in mathematics and special education to improve performance from veteran teachers could have a
positive impact on student performance.
Improving school-level administrators’ instructional supervision skills will allow them to better observe and
address weaknesses on their own staff. Some of our lower-achieving schools have experienced high turnover in
leadership due to the challenges and rigor of leading struggling schools. Exit interviews show that many leaders
do not feel adequately supported or do not have the expertise to manage the academic and professional learning
needs of the sites. Stronger mentoring and communication with site leaders are being pursued so that successful
school leaders can help support newer principals and administrators. To support growth and reinforce strength in
learner performance, Parnassus leadership proposes these theories of action:
1. If system leaders collaborating with site leaders can analyze and use data more effectively to identify
learners in need and train our instructors effectively on proven pedagogical strategies, then we may
increase opportunities for improved outcomes such as graduation rates, reduced achievement gaps,
and increase overall assessment performance.
2. If system leaders can emulate and scale the tutoring and reteaching programs present in ELA courses to
include other areas such as math and science, we may see more effective support for struggling learners
in math and science.
The Parnassus School District leadership is engaging in the continuous improvement process with fidelity and
looks forward to the feedback from the Accreditation Engagement Review.
Discussion:
The required analysis for student performance will be a crucial step in the self-assessment process. In this
example, the system has identified the assessments used to make determinations, including the state-level
assessments and the global-level assessment of SAT. Additionally, the institution addresses overall school
performance through the analysis of graduation rates over time.
One of the key elements in this required analysis is to make determinations of why scores are increasing,
decreasing, or remaining static. The narrative provides some information on specific interventions and notes that
overall scores do not always tell the entire story: disaggregated data showed that there were gaps in performance
amongst subgroups. Additionally, the system indicated that attrition in site leadership could be contributing
to falling or static scores. The system noted that increasing mentoring and communication was a first step to
addressing this issue and also included that data analysis skills would be needed so that leaders at the sites could
understand what needed to be addressed.
The school has met the key requirements for this analysis by providing information on what is going well and what
requires improvement. Additionally, the leaders provided information on what they believed were root causes of
these trends. By engaging in this process with fidelity, the school now has an excellent understanding on many
elements of learner performance and will have some solid evidence to support many of the Cognia Performance

The Parnassus Unified School District (PSD) considers stakeholder feedback an essential element of the
continuous improvement process. To this end, PSD includes representation from all stakeholder groups in both
district-level leadership groups and all site-based councils. The district-level strategic planning committee meets
twice annually to review the strategic plan and districtwide feedback data to inform their decision-making on
modifications and updates on the district strategic plan. Site-based councils meet monthly to discuss site-based
issues, track the continuous improvement plans, and analyze feedback data when it is available.
PSD utilizes the Cognia Improvement Platform to conduct stakeholder surveys twice annually. Each site
administers (where appropriate) the Elementary School Student Survey (ESSS), the Middle/High School Student
Survey (MHSS), the Family Survey (FS), and the Educator Survey (ES) twice annually, once in September and
once in April to gauge stakeholder feedback. This survey data is collected longitudinally so that ongoing progress
on community perceptions can be analyzed and acted upon. Because the PSD uses an additional systemwide
survey to gauge the perceptions of stakeholders using the Cognia platform (but not a certified content survey),
we have rated our evaluative criteria as a 3 in Item Quality. The other ratings were Administration: 3, Number of
Responses: 3, and Equity of Respondents: 2. Administration was rated at a 3 because families did not meet the
threshold for responses that were anticipated; however, the other stakeholder groups responded in high numbers.
While all target populations were represented, the response rate was between 50% and 75%, which met the
criteria for a rating of 3 in the Number of Responses category. The Equity rating was at 2 because there were gaps
in the response rate between subgroups, namely a low response rate from the families in our Title I schools.
The current September responses to the surveys show that 80% of the elementary learners, 76% of the middle/
high school learners, 96% of the professional staff, and 23% of the families responded to the survey. High learner
responses are attributed to the Advisory Program, which allocates time in the program to respond to these
surveys. Additionally, staff members utilize professional development time twice a year to answer the surveys.
Families and parents are emailed the surveys and are also provided time twice annually at board meetings and
time during several site-based events to respond to the surveys. While learner and staff responses are high, the
district leadership believes they could improve the response rate for families and parents by including the survey
links in newsletters and publishing the links on the district website.
Recent results from the learners show that at all levels, a welcoming environment, respect, and caring are the
most common selections regarding the learning environment. At the middle/high school level, learners frequently
responded that teachers did not ask what the learners thought about the lessons but did indicate that the use
of digital resources were common in daily activities. The sites are considering a professional development

were promising, as recent professional development has focused on high levels of classroom engagement.
Learners responded that classes were engaging and that working collaboratively with others was a frequent

response. On the other hand, many elementary learners indicated that worksheets were common activities,
and solving problems scored lower than in previous years. The sites have attributed these responses to statelevel
changes in required curriculum and that lesson-plan development has been started over for several thirdthrough
fifth-grade ELA courses. The system is in the process of comparing classroom observation data to see if
there is a correlation between the survey results and the observed classroom environment.
The system leaders, in collaboration with stakeholders from across the district, have devised theories of action to
address stakeholder concerns that surfaced during the analysis of the feedback data:
1. If system leaders develop additional opportunities for families to respond to surveys to increase
feedback, then stakeholders may have an increased voice in system issues.
2. If the professional development program continues to target learner engagement, then classrooms may
become even more interactive, and learners may engage with the curriculum more successfully.
3. If sites focus on training classified employees in protocols and procedures to welcome guests and
families. Then stakeholders may see the schools as a warm and inviting place.
Parnassus strongly believes that stakeholder feedback is a critical element to the district’s success and
endeavors to engage all stakeholders in the learning environment.
Discussion:
Stakeholder feedback is often a challenging area for systems as the data collected is often qualitative data

• System classroom observation plan
• Analyzed eleot system ratings
• Analyzed site-based eleot ratings
• Professional learning plan
• Theory of action statements
Parnassus Unified School District (PSD) has utilized the Cognia eleot for classroom observations since 2020.
During that time, all schools in the system were required to train a core team of observers in the protocol using
the available seats provided by Cognia. Each elementary site has a team of six trained observers, while the high
schools have a team of twelve trained observers. Each of the sites prepared an observation plan and schedule to
168
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
meet the requirements of every learning environment being observed during the school year at least three times.
Additionally, twelve of the system leadership team members were trained in the protocol and provided additional
support for the sites to reach their observation goals.
Because PSD utilizes eleot, the first category of the evaluative criteria was rated at 4. The remaining ECs were
rated as 4 because the system ensures that all observers are fully certified in eleot and that all observations meet
the full criteria of the observation requirements. Observation data is collected and analyzed on two main levels:
site-based observation data and systemwide observation data. Additionally, the high school observations are
further disaggregated by department and subject matter. Each site utilized professional learning time quarterly
to analyze observation data and make recommendations to the professional learning team at the system level
and at the site level. While there are seven major categories in the observation tool, and all of them are evaluated
during the classroom observations, the system has focused on the engagement and high expectations categories
for this analysis.
Results from the system level show that learner engagement is increasing in K–8 elementary levels, particularly
in third grade reading classes. This is likely a direct result of focused professional development for third grade
teachers to engage all learners in specific reading engagement strategies. In the other elementary levels,
engagement is relatively stable. Additional professional learning will focus on the strategies that were successful
at the third grade so other teachers can successfully engage learners in all subjects. High school engagement
varies significantly by department. Content involving CTE, arts, physical education, and science were high in
engagement, while ELA and math classes were much lower. Math classes ranked the lowest on engagement,
although the scores were higher than those from the previous year.
On the system level, the high expectations ratings were higher than those of the previous year; however, last
year’s ratings were highly affected by the need to teach to newly adopted standards from the state. When
disaggregated, the ratings for learners being able to express and describe high quality work was rated as a 3.4,
which was an increase from the previous year of 3.1. The analysis team believes that this higher rating was the
result of very specific instructions and materials produced to facilitate online learning, a skill that has now been
successfully transferred back into the live classroom. The highest increase in the category was learners being
self-directed, which was rated at 3.3, a significant increase from last year’s score of 2.4. Again, this information
was believed to be a skill augmented by remote instruction, as learners were required to independently engage
with course materials more frequently than in previous years. Survey analysis confirmed this interpretation by the
leadership team.
An integral part of the instructional model for PSD includes the use of data to inform instructional decisions such
as when to reteach or approach content in a different manner. To support this process, professional development
will be implemented in the upcoming year that focuses on improving instructional staff’s use of formative
assessment, including the process of checking for understanding several times during a lesson. Supplementing
these skills will be additional coaching on implementing the checks for understanding using active classroom
techniques. As part of the system’s continuous improvement plan, growth in the progress monitoring and active
learning environment are targeted for specific improvement in the coming school year. The theories of action that
the system is adopting are as follows:
1. If professional learning is provided in the progress monitoring of learners, overall eleot scores may rise in
this category and perhaps improve overall student performance.
2. If system leaders continue to offer feedback from the observations, then teachers may continue to
create engaging and active learning environments so that learner performance may increase.
All system leaders and site leaders are committed to leveraging the eleot to improve learner performance and
believe that continued professional learning will improve the capacity of all instructional staff to increase learner
engagement and success.
Discussion:
Analyzing learner environments is a key element in the self-assessment process. Learner engagement
and success is at the heart of most schools, and it includes a broad spectrum of potential topics, including
169
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
engagement, rigor, teacher effectiveness, and even culture of the institution. Given that, the analysis above does
not try to cover everything germane to learning environments but does focus on specific elements. The above
system leverages the Effective Learning Environments Observation Tool (eleot) to provide feedback on learner
engagement, specifically in high expectations and overall learner engagement. The system leaders provided a
brief overview of the process and the results from recent analysis sessions.
Additionally, note that while the observation data might be considered a single item of evidence, the way the
system disaggregated the data creates multiple data points in addition to the inclusion of the professional
learning plan. Both the findings and the root causes of those findings were discussed in the narrative and
drove the creation of the theories of action. Also note that the system addresses what is going well and where
improvements are needed to increase overall performance on the observation tool and potentially learner
performance.

Activities
Group Activity
Identifying Data Sources
Materials Needed: chart paper and markers for each group; materials for taking notes in Part II
Time: 60–120 minutes
Part I
Divide into small groups.
Option A: Divide into four small groups. Assign each group one category of data sources: Documentation,
Observations, Perceptions, Performance. Have each group brainstorm and list on chart paper all of the sources of
data the institution has for that category.
Extension for Option A: Have the groups rotate to each category to review the data sources already
listed and add any additional data sources for the category.
Do a gallery walk and/or debrief as a group to share the variety of data sources for each category.
Option B: Have each small group brainstorm and list on chart paper all the sources of data the institution has for
all four categories: Documentation, Observations, Perceptions, Performance. Collect the chart papers from each
group and combine them into an unduplicated list for each of the four categories. Debrief as a group to share the
variety of data sources for each category.
Part II
After debriefing all the available data sources for the institution, discuss the following questions. You can split
into small groups again and assign each group one of the questions for discussion or conduct a whole group
discussion. This could also be done as a separate session at another time.
1. In what areas do we have insufficient data? Where are there gaps? Where do we need to collect
additional data to clarify what we know so far?
2. What sources of data need to be “cleaned”? Which data sources may be biased or not valid? Which data
sources are overly broad and will need to be cited more precisely?
3. For each data source, how much trend data do we have (e.g., multiple administrations, evidence of review
and revision, year-over-year data)? Where are we lacking trend data?
Based on the discussion, develop an action plan to address any issues with your data sources and begin to
clean and organize the data. The action plan can be developed in this session with the whole group, in a separate
session at another time, or through delegation to a subgroup. Delegate the implementation of the action plan
to your leadership team, school improvement team, or other group to complete as part of the Self-Assessment
process.
175
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Group Activity
Developing Findings
Materials Needed: lists of cleaned data sources by category, scissors, tape, chart paper, sticky notes, markers/
pens, large work surface for each group
Time: 60–120 minutes
Note: This activity can be conducted multiple times to support specific activities like the development of your
institution’s improvement plan, student performance diagnostic, or stakeholder feedback diagnostic; or to identify
the institution’s strengths and areas for improvement more broadly. Outputs from this activity can support the
reflection section of the Self-Assessment Diagnostic as well as the narratives for each key characteristic.
Part I: Identifying Themes
Review the available data sources as a group. Break into small groups, providing each group with the full list of
cleaned data sources. Have groups cut apart the lists into individual data sources or write each data source on a
sticky note. Optionally, you can provide sets of cards or pieces of paper with each data source already identified
on a separate card/paper.
Without talking or discussion, have each group review the data sources by spreading them out on the table so
everyone can see all data sources. Look for ideas that seem to be related in some way. Group these related data
sources together on the table or on chart paper. Group members can reorder and regroup the data sources
throughout the exercise. Continue the process until all data sources are grouped. If a data source seems to belong
in two groups, make a duplicate of the data source on a sticky note.
Next, have each small group begin a discussion to identify themes or categories for each grouping. Groups can
discuss any patterns, reasons for moving controversial data sources, etc. As the themes develop, have groups
note if there is adequate data within the theme or if more may be needed. Groups can continue to move data
sources around until all sources are grouped to everyone’s satisfaction and a theme is selected for each grouping.
There may be some data sources that don’t seem to fit with any theme—these can be set to the side. Write
the theme on a sticky note at the top of the grouping. Tape the data sources into place on the chart paper to
document the themed groupings.
Post the chart paper from each small group on the wall. Conduct a gallery walk. Then, debrief with the whole
group to note where there were similar themes across groups, where there were differences, and how groups
related the various data sources.
Part II: Interpreting Findings
Now that your data sources have been organized into themes, you can begin to transform the information into
findings. Findings help us determine what we do well and what we do not do so well. Assign 3–4 themes to each
small group. You may have each small group return to their own themes to pick the ones to focus on or look at the
complete set of themes that emerged from Part I and select and broad sampling to divide across small groups.
For each theme, the group should write at least one clear statement that indicates what the data sources/
information within each theme tells them. Findings can be strengths or areas that need improvement. Some
themes may have multiple findings based on the data sources. Some data sources may need to be “cleaned”
further to identify the useful information that can support a finding. Groups can make note of themes with data
sources that need to be further cleaned.
176
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Here are some examples of findings statements:
• Student performance in seventh grade language arts has been lower than sixth- and eighth-grade
performance for the past three years.
• Items related to culture from multiple surveys (learner, teacher, parent) indicate strong support for the
leadership of our school.
• On the SAT, students perform well above the average on language arts and below average on mathematics.
• Student absenteeism has been increasing for the last four years.
Once all groups have identified at least one finding within each theme, have each small group report out their
findings statements to the whole group. Collect the findings statements for further work in the Self-Assessment
process.
177
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Group Activity
Writing Theories of Action
Materials Needed: findings statements, themes and data sources from Developing Findings activity
Time: 60–90 minutes
Divide into four small groups, with one group focused on each of the four key characteristics: Culture of Learning,
Leadership for Learning, Engagement of Learning, and Growth in Learning. Provide each group with findings
statements related to the key characteristic they will focus on. Each group should have at least one findings
statement.
Have each group prioritize the findings statements within their key characteristic. Focus on the findings that are
most important to focus improvement efforts on within the institution. Select the findings that can be reasonably
addressed through current resources and capacity or with minimal additional resources.
For each prioritized finding, have the small groups conduct a root cause analysis to determine the underlying
cause(s) of the finding. Reference the data sources from the Developing Findings activity if previously conducted.
Root cause analysis answers the question, “Why are these results what they are?”
Option A: Groups can use a fishbone diagram to identify possible root causes.
Ishikawa Diagram
Option B: Groups can use the Five Whys technique to get to the underlying cause(s). Form the finding into a
problem statement. Then, ask “why” to get to an underlying hypothesized reason for the problem. Ask “why” for
that new reason statement. Continue to ask “why” enough times to identify the root cause of the original problem
(finding). Remember that there can be more than one root cause, so groups may end up with a matrix with
different branches (see below).
Issue Diagram
178
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Once the small groups have identified the root cause(s), have them select the top one or two causes. Then
identify who might have the greatest influence on that cause, and describe actions that can bring about a desired
change.
“After discussion, mathematics faculty felt that curriculum alignment was the highest priority; however, that is not
scheduled until two years from now. Therefore, the faculty decided the three most important causes in our control
are: 1) providing more real-world projects, 2) focusing on critical thinking and problem solving in instruction, and 3)
building a professional development plan to improve math instruction.”
Then have small groups develop an “if/then/so what” statement as a theory of action for the original finding.
“If math teachers engage in professional development to learn how to increase critical thinking and implement
real-world projects into math classes, then students will be more engaged in learning math so that they will score
higher on the math portion of the SAT.”
After all small groups have developed theories of action for each of the prioritized findings, have each group
report out to the whole group. As a whole group, determine which findings from the entire set of findings and
theories of action should be prioritized for the institution. Remember to select only the number of findings that
can be reasonably addressed through current resources and capacity. Aim for at least one finding for each key
characteristic. You will use these findings and theories of action in your narratives for each key characteristic. The
findings and action plans can inform your continuous improvement plan within your institution.
179
Self-Assessment Workbook K–12 and Postsecondary Institutions BACK TO TOC
Group Activity
Unpacking the Standards
Materials Needed: standards cards for each small group
Time: 45–60 minutes
Divide into at least three groups. Have each group select one of the Performance Standards from the 31 available
cards. To cover the most standards, provide each group with only 10 of the standards to select from, splitting the
31 standards among the three groups.
Within each group, read the selected standard and examine the elements. Note how the elements align with the
rubric levels.
1. Identify any additional key terms where you need clarification.
2. Identify possible evidence your institution may already have, what you need to collect, and how impactful
that evidence may be for rating the standard.
3. Discuss an initial rating of the standard for your institution and cite specific reasons and evidence you
used to reach that rating.
With the full group, have each small group debrief their conversation by sharing the rating for the standard and the
rationale and evidence used to reach that rating.
Repeat the above process at least twice more, which will allow your team to unpack at least nine of the standards.

Group Activity
World Café: Deep Dive into the Standards
Materials Needed: chart paper and markers for each table (4); copies of the guiding questions (below) and
Cognia Performance Standards (without rubrics) for each table
Time: 90 minutes
Divide into four groups, one for each of the themes synthesized in the context of the key characteristics of what a
good institution does in support of learners, teachers, and leaders and the related standards.
At each table for each 15-minute round:
1. Choose a recorder. This person will capture the conversation notes on the chart paper for the round.
2. Choose a table host. This person will remain at the table for the next round and will share key ideas,
themes, and questions from the last round with the new table participants. The table host will only stay
for one round and then move to the next table at the next rotation.
Have each group discuss how the primary standards relate to the key characteristic. Consider the guiding questions/
statements for each key characteristic, listed below. This will help to identify possible sources of evidence that could be
used for each key characteristic.
Culture of Learning: (Primary Standards 1–6)
• What evidence illustrates that the learners, parents, and educators feel connected to the purpose and work
of the institution?
• What evidence illustrates that the learners, parents, and educators consistently behave in alignment with the
stated values and norms of the institution?
• Describe activities and other engagements that reflect the mission, beliefs, and expectations of the
institution.
Leadership for Learning: (Primary Standards 7–15)
• How do leaders communicate expectations for learning and monitor progress toward meeting such
expectations?
• Describe examples of behaviors and actions by leaders that influence and have a positive impact on the
culture of the institution.
• In what ways do leaders model and engage in learning while supporting others to do so?
Engagement of Learning: (Primary Standards 16–23)
• How does the instructional environment ensure active engagement of learners? How do you know?
• Do learners participate with confidence? How do you know? What strategies are employed to improve the
confidence level of the learners?
• What strategies are employed to provide learners agency over their learning? Provide key examples of
student agency.
Growth in Learning: (Primary Standards 24–31)
• Are students ready to engage in their next transition in learning? What evidence supports this belief?
• Are students academically prepared to transition to the next level of learning? What evidence supports this
belief?
• Are students meeting expectations in knowledge and skill acquisition? What evidence supports this belief?
