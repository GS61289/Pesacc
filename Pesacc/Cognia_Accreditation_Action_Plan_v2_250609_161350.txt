Synthesized Self-Assessment
Requirements and Criteria
This document synthesizes the key requirements and criteria for the Cognia
accreditation self-assessment phase, based on the provided documentation.
1. Overall Process & Timeline
Purpose: The self-assessment is a core part of the continuous improvement
process required for Cognia accreditation.
Cycle: Accreditation runs on a six-year cycle, with the self-assessment preceding
the Engagement Review.
Timeline: The self-assessment must be completed by Spring 2026.
Key Phases: The process involves data collection, analysis, synthesis, rating
against standards, writing narratives, and preparing for the Engagement Review.
Continuous Improvement: The process should be authentic, focused on
improvement, and involve relevant stakeholders.
Policy Adherence: The school must adhere to all Cognia policies, standards, and
assurances throughout the process.
Reporting: Progress reports may be required by Cognia.

2. Standards & Criteria
Framework: The assessment is based on the Cognia Performance Standards (30+
standards).
Key Characteristics: Standards are grouped under four Key Characteristics:
Culture of Learning, Leadership for Learning, Engagement of Learning, and Growth
in Learning.
Rating: Each standard must be rated using the provided 4-level rubrics.
Evidence: Each rating must be supported by specific, documented evidence.
Assurances: The institution must meet relevant Cognia Assurances.
3. Data Collection & Analysis
Required Analyses: Three specific analyses are mandatory:
Student Performance Analysis
Stakeholder Feedback Analysis (Learners, Families, Teachers required)
Learning Environment Observation Analysis (using a tool like eleot)
Data Types: Collect diverse data types: Documentation, Observations, Perceptions,
and Performance.
Data Sources: Identify and evaluate existing data sources first. Use the provided
templates ( Required Analyses Template ) to document sources, trend data,
and comments.
Data Cleaning: Crucial step involving evaluating data relevance, validity, accuracy,
sample size, collection methods, bias, and representation. Cleaned data sources
should be specific (e.g., specific survey items, specific handbook pages).
Analysis Process (5 Steps):
Understand Purpose
Identify & Evaluate Data Sources
Select & Clean Data Sources
Analyze & Synthesize Information (Identify themes, strengths, weaknesses)
Interpret Findings, Prioritize, & Develop Theory of Action (Root cause analysis,
if/then/so that statements)
Disaggregation: Data (especially student performance) should be disaggregated
by relevant subgroups.
Longitudinal Data: Use trend data (multiple years/administrations) where
possible.
Evaluative Criteria (EC): Rate data sources/processes using the specific ECs
provided for each required analysis.

1. Quality Assurance & Review Committee (QARC)
Assignment: The QARC is formally assigned as defined in the
team_structure.md document.
Mandate: To conduct an independent, objective review of the first complete draft
of the Self-Assessment Report before final revisions and submission. The QARC
ensures the report is comprehensive, accurate, consistent, clearly written, and fully
aligned with Cognia standards, policies, and requirements.
Composition:
Chair: [Senior Staff Member not on ASC or KCWG Chair - e.g., Experienced
Department Head]
Members: (Selected for objectivity; ideally not primary authors of report
sections)
[Teacher Name 1 (Different Dept/Grade)]
[Teacher Name 2 (Different Dept/Grade)]
[Admin Staff/Support Staff Name]
[External Peer Reviewer (Optional - e.g., staff from another accredited
school)]
Reporting: The QARC reports its findings and recommendations directly to the
Accreditation Steering Committee (ASC).
2. Quality Assurance Steps & Timeline
Step 1: Receive Draft Report (End of March 2026)
The Accreditation Coordinator compiles the first complete draft of the Self-
Assessment Report (including Executive Summary, Required Analyses
narratives, Key Characteristic narratives, ratings, and links/references to
evidence) and submits it to the QARC Chair.
Step 2: Conduct Review (First two weeks of April 2026)
The QARC Chair distributes sections or the full report to members for review.
QARC members independently and collectively review the draft against the
following criteria:
Completeness: Are all required sections present (Executive Summary, 3
Required Analyses, 4 Key Characteristic Narratives, all standards rated)?
Alignment with Standards: Do the ratings accurately reflect the
evidence presented and the rubric descriptions for each Cognia
Performance Standard?
Evidence Quality: Is the cited evidence sufficient, relevant, specific, and
verifiable? Does it clearly support the ratings and narrative points?

▪
Analysis Soundness: Are the findings in the Required Analyses logical,
data-driven, and well-supported? Are theories of action clear?
Narrative Quality: Are the narratives clear, concise, well-organized, and
consistent? Do they effectively tell the school's story in relation to the
standards and characteristics? Is the tone appropriate?
Consistency: Is there consistency in information and findings across
different sections of the report (e.g., between analyses and
characteristic narratives)?
Compliance: Does the report reflect adherence to Cognia policies and
assurances?
Step 3: Compile Feedback (Third week of April 2026)
QARC members consolidate their findings.
The QARC Chair compiles a single, comprehensive feedback report detailing
strengths, weaknesses, specific areas needing revision, and actionable
recommendations.
Step 4: Submit Feedback Report (End of Third week of April 2026)
The QARC Chair submits the formal feedback report to the ASC.
Step 5: Feedback Discussion (Optional - Fourth week of April 2026)
The QARC Chair meets with the ASC/Accreditation Coordinator to discuss the
feedback and clarify any points.
3. Post-Review
The ASC is responsible for ensuring the QARC's feedback is appropriately
addressed by the relevant teams during the revision phase (April-May 2026).
The QARC's role is advisory; final editorial control rests with the ASC and the
Principal/Head of School.
