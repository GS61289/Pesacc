Key Characteristics
All the Performance Standards are related to one or more Key Characteristics, based on the unique context of the institution.
Performance Standards have been assigned a primary and secondary key characteristic that Cognia feels they most closely
align with; however, your institution may see the Standards connecting to the Key Characteristics in different ways based on
your context.
Schools and Systems
Key Characteristic Definition
Culture of Learning A good institution nurtures and sustains a healthy culture for learning. In a healthy culture, learners,
parents, and educators feel connected to the purpose and work of the institution as well as behave in

the mission, beliefs, and expectations of the institution (e.g., student work; physical appearance of

Leadership for Learning The ability of a leader to provide leadership for learning is a key attribute of a good institution.
Leaders who engage in their own learning while tangibly supporting the learning process for learners
and teachers have a significant positive impact on the success of others. Leaders must also

and purpose. The expectations are embedded in the culture of the institution, reflected by learners’,
teachers’, and leaders’ behaviors and attitudes toward learning.
Engagement of Learning A good institution ensures that learners are engaged in the learning environment. Learners who are
engaged in the learning environment participate with confidence and display agency over their own
learning. A good institution adopts policies and engages in practices that support all learners being
included in the learning process.
Growth in Learning A good institution positively impacts learners throughout their journey of learning. A positive impact
on the learner is reflected in readiness to engage in and preparedness for the next transition in their
learning. Growth in learning is also reflected in learners’ ability to meet expectations in knowledge
and skill acquisition.
